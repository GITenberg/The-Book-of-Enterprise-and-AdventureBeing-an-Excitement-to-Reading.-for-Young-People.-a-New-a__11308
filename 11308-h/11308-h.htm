    <h2>PREFACE.</h2>

    <p>The object of this Volume is that of inducing young people
    to read, to cultivate in them a habit of reading and
    reflection, and to excite the imagination, the feelings, and
    the better emotions of their nature in a pleasurable and
    judicious manner.</p>

    <p>The pieces selected are such as will be likely to exert a
    beneficial influence upon the reader, to inspire him with
    heroic enthusiasm, and to lead him to despise danger.</p>

    <p>In our perpetually migrating population, no one can tell who
    will not be called upon to brave the vicissitudes of "flood and
    field;" and to show how perils may be surmounted, and
    privations endured with energy and patience, is to teach no
    unimportant lesson.</p>

    <p>Nothing whatever has been introduced into this Volume, but
    such subjects as will teach a dependence upon Divine
    Providence, in aid of self-reliance and self-sacrifice, while
    details of war and bloodshed have been studiously avoided.</p>

    <a name="HOSPITALITY_OF_THE_ARAB"></a>

    <h3>HOSPITALITY OF THE ARAB.</h3>

    <p>In 1804, Osman Bardissy was the most influential of the
    Mameluke Beys, and virtually governed Egypt. Mehemet Ali, then
    rising into power, succeeded in embroiling this powerful old
    chief with Elfy Bey, another of the Mamelukes. The latter
    escaped to England, where he was favourably received, and
    promised assistance by our government against Osman, who was in
    the French interests. At this time a Sheikh of Bedouin stood
    high in Osman's confidence, and brought him intelligence that
    Elfy had landed at Alexandria. "Go, then," said the old Bey,
    "surprise his boat, and slay him on his way up the river; his
    spoil shall be your reward." The Sheikh lay in wait upon the
    banks of the Delta, and slew all the companions of the rival
    Bey: Elfy himself escaped in the darkness, and made his way to
    an Arab encampment before sunrise. Going straight to the
    Sheikh's tent, which is known by a spear standing in front of
    it, he entered, and hastily devoured some bread that he found
    there. The Sheikh was absent; but his wife exclaimed, on seeing
    the fugitive, "I know you, Elfy Bey, and my husband's life,
    perhaps at his moment, depends upon his taking yours. Rest now
    and refresh yourself, then take the best horse you can find,
    and fly. The moment you are out of our horizon, the tribe will
    be in pursuit of you." The Bey escaped to the Thebaid, and the
    disappointed Sheikh presented himself to his employer. Osman
    passionately demanded of him if it was true that his wife had
    saved the life of his deadliest enemy, when in her power. "Most
    true, praised be Allah!" replied the Sheikh, drawing himself
    proudly up, and presenting a jewel-hilted dagger to the old
    Bey; "this weapon," he continued, "was your gift to me in the
    hour of your favour; had I met Elfy Bey, it should have freed
    you from your enemy. Had my wife betrayed the hospitality of
    the tent, it should have drank her blood; and now, you may use
    it against myself," he added, as he flung it at the Mameluke's
    feet. This reverence for hospitality is one of the wild virtues
    that has survived from the days of the patriarchs, and it is
    singularly contrasted, yet interwoven with other and apparently
    opposite tendencies. The Arab will rob you, if he is able; he
    will even murder you, if it suits his purpose; but, once under
    the shelter of his tribe's black tents, or having eaten of his
    salt by the wayside, you have as much safety in his company as
    his heart's blood can purchase for you. The Bedouins are
    extortionate to strangers, dishonest to each other, and
    reckless of human life. On the other hand, they are faithful to
    their trust, brave after their fashion, temperate, and patient
    of hardship and privation beyond belief. Their sense of right
    and wrong is not founded on the Decalogue, as may be well
    imagined, yet, from such principles as they profess they rarely
    swerve. Though they will freely risk their lives to steal, they
    will not contravene the wild rule of the desert. If a
    wayfarer's camel sinks and dies beneath its burden, the owner
    draws a circle round the animal in the sand, and follows the
    caravan. No Arab will presume to touch that lading, however
    tempting. Dr. Robinson mentions that he saw a tent hanging from
    a tree near Mount Sinai, which his Arabs said had then been
    there a twelvemonth, and never would be touched until its owner
    returned in search of it.</p>
    <hr style="width: 65%;">
    <a name="HORRORS_OF_AFRICAN_WARFARE"></a>

    <h3>HORRORS OF AFRICAN WARFARE.</h3>

    <p>There appears to be a wild caprice amongst the institutions;
    if such they may be called, of all these tropical nations. In a
    neighbouring state to that of Abyssinia, the king, when
    appointed to the regal dignity, retires into an island, and is
    never again visible to the eyes of men but once--when his
    ministers come to strangle him; for it may not be that the
    proud monarch of Behr should die a natural death. No men, with
    this fatal exception, are ever allowed even to set foot upon
    the island, which is guarded by a band of Amazons. In another
    border country, called Habeesh, the monarch is dignified with
    the title of Tiger. He was formerly Malek of Shendy, when it
    was invaded by Ismael Pasha, and was even then designated by
    this fierce cognomen. Ismael, Mehemet Ali's second son,
    advanced through Nubia claiming tribute and submission from all
    the tribes Nemmir (which signifies Tiger), the king of Shendy,
    received him hospitably, as Mahmoud, our dragoman, informed us,
    and, when he was seated in his tent, waited on him to learn his
    pleasure. "My pleasure is," replied the invader, "that you
    forthwith furnish me with slaves, cattle, and money, to the
    value of 100,000 dollars."--"Pooh!" said Nemmir, "you jest; all
    my country could not produce what you require in one hundred
    moons."--"Ha! Wallah!" was the young Pasha's reply, and he
    struck the Tiger across the face with his pipe. If he had done
    so to his namesake of the jungle, the insult could not have
    roused fiercer feelings of revenge, but the human animal did
    not shew his wrath at once. "It is well," he replied; "let the
    Pasha rest; <i>to-morrow he shall have nothing more to
    ask</i>." The Egyptian, and the few Mameluke officers of his
    staff, were tranquilly smoking towards evening, entertained by
    some dancing-girls, whom the Tiger had sent to amuse them; when
    they observed that a huge pile of dried stalks of Indian corn
    was rising rapidly round the tent. "What means this?" inquired
    Ismael angrily; "am not I Pasha?"--"It is but forage for your
    highness's horses," replied the Nubian; "for, were your troops
    once arrived, the people would fear to approach the camp."
    Suddenly the space is filled with smoke, the tent-curtains
    shrivel up in flames, and the Pasha and his comrades find
    themselves encircled in what they well know is their funeral
    pyre. Vainly the invader implores mercy, and assures the Tiger
    of his warm regard for him and all his family; vainly he
    endeavours to break through the fiery fence that girds him
    round; a thousand spears bore him back into the flames, and the
    Tiger's triumphant yell and bitter mockery mingle with his
    dying screams. The Egyptians perished to a man. Nemmir escaped
    up the country, crowned with savage glory, and married the
    daughter of a king, who soon left him his successor, and the
    Tiger still defies the old Pasha's power. The latter, however,
    took a terrible revenge upon his people: he burnt all the
    inhabitants of the village nearest to the scene of his son's
    slaughter, and cut off the right hands of five hundred men
    besides. So much for African warfare.</p>
    <hr style="width: 65%;">
    <a name="CROCODILE_SHOOTING"></a>

    <h3>CROCODILE SHOOTING.</h3>

    <p>The first time a man fires at a crocodile is an epoch in his
    life. We had only now arrived in the waters where they abound;
    for it is a curious fact that none are ever seen below Mineych,
    though Herodotus speaks of them as fighting with the dolphins,
    at the mouths of the Nile. A prize had been offered for the
    first man who detected a crocodile, and the crew had now been
    two days on the alert in search of them. Buoyed up with the
    expectation of such game, we had latterly reserved our fire for
    them exclusively; and the wild-duck and turtle, nay, even the
    vulture and the eagle, had swept past, or soared above, in
    security. At length the cry of "Timseach, timseach!" was heard
    from half-a-dozen claimants of the proffered prize, and
    half-a-dozen black fingers were eagerly pointed to a spit of
    sand, on which were strewn apparently some logs of trees. It
    was a covey of crocodiles! Hastily and silently the boat was
    run in shore. R. was ill, so I had the enterprise to myself,
    and clambered up the steep bank with a quicker pulse than when
    I first levelled a rifle at a Highland deer. My intended
    victims might have prided themselves on their superior
    nonchalance; and, indeed, as I approached them, there seemed to
    be a sneer on their ghastly mouths and winking eyes. Slowly
    they rose, one after the other, and waddled to the water, all
    but one, the most gallant or most gorged of the party. He lay
    still until I was within a hundred yards of him; then slowly
    rising on his fin-like legs, he lumbered towards the river,
    looking askance at me, with an expression of countenance that
    seemed to say, "He can do me no harm; however, I may as well
    have a swim." I took aim at the throat of this supercilious
    brute, and, as soon as my hand steadied, the very pulsation of
    my finger pulled the trigger. Bang! went the gun! whizz! flew
    the bullet; and my excited ear could catch the <i>thud</i> with
    which it plunged into the scaly leather of his neck. His waddle
    became a plunge, the waves closed over him, and the sun shone
    on the calm water, as I reached the brink of the shore, that
    was still indented by the waving of his gigantic tail. But
    there is blood upon the water, and he rises for a moment to the
    surface. "A hundred piasters for the timseach," I exclaimed,
    and half-a-dozen Arabs plunged into the stream. There! he rises
    again, and the blacks dash at him as if he hadn't a tooth in
    his head. Now he is gone, the waters close over him, and I
    never saw him since. From that time we saw hundreds of
    crocodiles of all sizes, and fired shots,--enough of them for a
    Spanish revolution; but we never could get possession of any,
    even if we hit them, which to this day remains doubtful.</p>

    <a name="Remarkable_Instance_of_Courage_in_a_Lady"></a>

    <h2><b>Remarkable Instance of Courage in a Lady.</b></h2>

    <p>In the Life of Thomas Day, Esq., an anecdote is related of
    Miss B----, afterwards Mrs. Day, shewing with what remarkable
    effect presence of mind and courage can tame the ferocity of
    the brute creation.</p>

    <p>Miss B. was, on one occasion, walking in company with
    another young lady through a field, when a bull came running up
    to them with all the marks of malevolence. Her friend began to
    run towards the stile, but was prevented by Miss B., who told
    her, that as she could not reach the stile soon enough to save
    herself, and as it is the nature of these animals to attack
    persons in flight, her life would be in great danger if she
    attempted to run, and would be inevitably lost if she chanced
    to fall; but that, if she would steal gently to the stile, she
    herself would take off the bull's attention from her, by
    standing between them. Accordingly, turning her face towards
    the animal with the firmest aspect she could assume, she fixed
    her eyes steadily upon his. It is said by travellers, that a
    lion itself may be controlled by the steady looks of a human
    being; but that, no sooner a man turns his back, than the beast
    springs upon him as his prey. Miss B., to whom this property of
    animals seems to have been known, had the presence of mind to
    apply it to the safety of her friend and of herself. By her
    steady aspect she checked the bull's career; but he shewed the
    strongest marks of indignation at being so controlled, by
    roaring and tearing the ground with his feet and horns. While
    he was thus engaged in venting his rage on the turf, she
    cautiously retreated a few steps, without removing her eyes
    from him. When he observed that she had retreated, he advanced
    till she stopped, and then he also stopped, and again renewed
    his frantic play. Thus by repeated degrees she at length
    arrived at the stile, where she accomplished her safety; and
    thus, by a presence of mind rarely seen in a person of her
    youth and sex, she not only saved herself, but also, at the
    hazard of her own life, protected her friend. Some days
    afterwards, this bull gored its master.</p>

    <h2><b>Indian Field Sports.</b></h2>

    <p>We give a few anecdotes illustrative of the above, from a
    work intitled "Sketches of Field Sports, as followed by the
    Natives of India," from the reading of which we have derived
    much pleasure. The authority is Dr. Johnson, East India
    Company's Service.</p>

    <p>He begins by informing his readers, that the "Shecarries"
    (or professed hunters) are generally Hindoos of a low caste,
    who gain their livelihood entirely by catching birds, hares,
    and all sorts of animals; some of them confine themselves to
    catching birds and hares, whilst others practise the art of
    catching birds and various animals; another description of them
    live by destroying tigers.</p>

    <a name="METHOD_OF_CATCHING_BIRDS"></a>

    <h3>METHOD OF CATCHING BIRDS.</h3>

    <p>Those who catch birds equip themselves with a framework of
    split bamboos, resembling the frame of a paper kite, the shape
    of the top of a coffin, and the height of a man, to which green
    bushes are fastened, leaving two loop-holes to see through, and
    one lower down for their rod to be inserted through. This
    framework, which is very light, they fasten before them when
    they are in the act of catching birds, by which means they have
    both hands at liberty, and are completely concealed from the
    view of the birds. The rod which they use is about twenty-four
    feet long, resembling a fishing-rod, the parts of which are
    inserted within one another, and the whole contained in a
    walking-stick.</p>

    <p>They also carry with them horse-hair nooses of different
    sizes and strength, which they fasten to the rod: likewise
    bird-lime, and a variety of calls for the different kinds of
    birds, with which they imitate them to the greatest nicety.
    They take with them likewise two lines to which horse-hair
    nooses are attached for catching larger birds, and a bag or net
    to carry their game.</p>

    <p>Thus equipped, they sally forth, and as they proceed through
    the different covers, they use calls for such birds as
    generally resort there, which from constant practice is well
    known to them, and if any birds answer their call they prepare
    accordingly for catching them; supposing it to be a bevy of
    quail, they continue calling them, until they get quite close;
    they then arm the top of their rod with a feather smeared with
    bird-lime, and pass it through the loop-hole in their frame of
    ambush, and to which they continue adding other parts, until
    they have five or six out, which they use with great dexterity,
    and touch one of the quail with the feather, which adheres to
    them; they then withdraw the rod, arm it again, and touch three
    or four more in the same manner before they attempt to secure
    any of them.</p>

    <p>In this way they catch all sorts of small birds not much
    larger than quail, on the ground and in trees. If a brown or
    black partridge answers their call, instead of bird-lime, they
    fasten a horse-hair noose to the top of their rod, and when
    they are close to the birds, they keep dipping the top of their
    rod with considerable skill until they fasten the noose on one
    of their necks; they then draw him in, and go on catching
    others in the same way. It is surprising to see with what cool
    perseverance they proceed. In a similar manner they catch all
    kinds of birds, nearly the size of partridges.</p>

    <a name="THE_HYENA"></a>

    <h3>THE HYENA.</h3>

    <p>A servant of Mr. William Hunter's, by name Thomas Jones, who
    lived at <i>Chittrah</i>, had a full grown hyena which ran
    loose about his house like a dog, and I have seen him play with
    it with as much familiarity. They feed on small animals and
    carrion, and I believe often come in for the prey left by
    tigers and leopards after their appetites have been satiated.
    They are great enemies of dogs, and kill numbers of them.</p>

    <p>The natives of India affirm that tigers, panthers, and
    leopards, have a great aversion to hyenas, on account of their
    destroying their young, which I believe they have an
    opportunity of doing, as the parents leave them during the
    greatest part of the day. The inhabitants, therefore, feel no
    apprehension in taking away the young whenever they find them,
    knowing the dam is seldom near.... Hyenas are slow in their
    pace, and altogether inactive; I have often seen a few terriers
    keep them at bay, and bite them severely by the hind quarter;
    their jaws, however, are exceedingly strong, and a single bite,
    without holding on more than a few seconds, is sufficient to
    kill a large dog. They stink horribly, make no earths of their
    own, lie under rocks, or resort to the earths of wolves, as
    foxes do to those of badgers; and it is not uncommon to find
    wolves and hyenas in the same bed of earths.</p>

    <p>I was informed by several gentlemen, of whose veracity I
    could not doubt, that Captain Richards, of the Bengal Native
    Infantry, had a servant of the tribe of <i>Shecarries</i>, who
    was in the habit of going into the earths of wolves, fastening
    strings on them, and on the legs of hyenas, and then drawing
    them out; he constantly supplied his master and the gentlemen
    at the station with them, who let them loose on a plain, and
    rode after them with spears, for practice and amusement. This
    man possessed such an acute and exquisite sense of smelling,
    that he could always tell by it if there were any animals in
    the earths, and could distinguish whether they were hyenas or
    wolves.</p>

    <a name="THE_BEAR"></a>

    <h3>THE BEAR.</h3>

    <p>Bears will often continue on the road in front of the
    palanquin for a mile or two, tumbling and playing all sorts of
    antics, as if they were taught to do so. I believe it is their
    natural disposition; for they certainly are the most amusing
    creatures imaginable in their wild state. It is no wonder that
    with monkeys they are led about to amuse mankind. It is
    astonishing, as well as ludicrous, to see them climb rocks, and
    tumble or rather roll down precipices. If they are attacked by
    any person on horseback, they stand erect on their hind legs,
    shewing a fine set of white teeth, and making a cackling kind
    of noise. If the horse comes near them, they try to catch him
    by the legs, and if they miss him, they tumble over and over
    several times. They are easily speared by a person mounted on a
    horse that is bold enough to go near them.</p>

    <a name="SAGACITY_OF_THE_ELEPHANT"></a>

    <h3>SAGACITY OF THE ELEPHANT.</h3>

    <p>An elephant belonging to Mr. Boddam, of the Bengal Civil
    Service, at <i>Gyah</i>, used every day to pass over a small
    bridge leading from his master's house into the town of
    <i>Gyah</i>. He one day refused to go over it, and it was with
    great difficulty, by goring him most cruelly with the
    <i>Hunkuss</i> [iron instrument], that the <i>Mahout</i>
    [driver] could get him to venture on the bridge, the strength
    of which he first tried with his trunk, shewing clearly that he
    suspected that it was not sufficiently strong. At last he went
    on, and before he could get over, the bridge gave way, and they
    were precipitated into the ditch, which killed the driver, and
    considerably injured the elephant. It is reasonable to suppose
    that the elephant must have perceived its feeble state when he
    last passed over it. It is a well known fact, that elephants
    will seldom or ever go over strange bridges, without first
    trying with their trunks if they be sufficiently strong to bear
    their weight,--nor will they ever go into a boat without doing
    the same.</p>

    <p>I had a remarkably quiet and docile elephant, which one day
    came home loaded with branches of trees for provender, followed
    by a number of villagers, calling for mercy (their usual cry
    when ill used); complaining that the <i>Mahout</i> had stolen a
    kid from them, and that it was then on the elephant, under the
    branches of the trees. The <i>Mahout</i> took an opportunity of
    decamping into the village and hiding himself. I ordered the
    elephant to be unloaded, and was surprised to see that he would
    not allow any person to come near to him, when at all other
    times he was perfectly tractable and obedient. Combining all
    the circumstances, I was convinced that the <i>Mahout</i> was
    guilty, and to get rid of the noise, I recompensed the people
    for the loss of their kid. As soon as they were gone away, the
    elephant allowed himself to be unloaded, and the kid was found
    under the branches, as described by the people. I learnt from
    my <i>Sarcar</i>, that similar complaints had been made to him
    before, and that the rascal of a <i>Mahout</i> made it a
    practice to ride the elephant into the midst of a herd of
    goats, and had taught him to pick up any of the young ones he
    directed; he had also accustomed him to steal their pumpions
    and other vegetables, that grew against the inside of their
    fences like French beans, which could only be reached by an
    elephant. He was the best <i>Mahout</i> I ever knew, and so
    great a rogue that I was obliged to discharge him.</p>

    <p>The very day that he left my service, the elephant's eyes
    were closed, which he did not open again in less than a
    fortnight, when it was discovered that he was blind. Two small
    eschars, one in each eye, were visible, which indicated pretty
    strongly that he had been made blind by some sharp instrument,
    most probably by a heated needle. The suspicion was very strong
    against the former keeper, of whom I never heard anything
    after. The elephant I frequently rode on, shooting, for many
    years after this, through heavy covers, intersected with
    ravines, rivers, and over hollow and uneven ground, and he
    scarcely ever made a false step with me, and never once
    tumbled. He used to touch the ground with his trunk on every
    spot where his feet were to be placed, and in so light and
    quick a manner as scarcely to be perceived. The <i>Mahout</i>
    would often make him remove large stones, lumps of earth, or
    timber, out of his way, frequently climb up and down banks that
    no horse could get over. He would also occasionally break off
    branches of trees that were in the way of the <i>Howdah</i>, to
    enable me to pass.</p>

    <p>Although perfectly blind, he was considered one of the best
    sporting elephants of his small size in the country, and he
    travelled at a tolerably good rate, and was remarkably easy in
    his paces.</p>
    <hr style="width: 65%;">
    <a name="ANECDOTES_OF_THE_TIGER"></a>

    <h3>ANECDOTES OF THE TIGER.</h3>

    <p>An occurrence nearly similar happened to me soon after,
    which put an end to my shooting on foot. From that time to the
    period of my leaving <i>Chittrah</i>, which was many years
    after, I always went out to shoot on an elephant. The
    circumstance I allude to was as follows:--Fifty or sixty people
    were beating a thick cover. I was on the outside of it, with a
    man holding my horse, and another servant with a hog's spear;
    when those who were driving the cover called <i>Suer! Suer!</i>
    which is the <i>Hindoostanee</i> name for hog. Seeing something
    move the bushes about twenty yards from me, and supposing it to
    be a hog, I fired at the spot, with ten or a dozen small balls.
    Instantly on the explosion of my gun, a tiger roared out, and
    came galloping straight towards us. I dipped under the horse's
    belly, and got on the opposite side from him. He came within a
    few yards of us, and then turned off growling into the
    cover.</p>

    <p>When the people came out, they brought with them a dead hog,
    partly devoured. These two cases, I think, shew clearly that
    tigers are naturally cowardly. They generally take their prey
    by surprise, and whenever they attack openly, it is reasonable
    to conclude that they must be extremely hungry; which I believe
    is often the case, as their killing animals of the forest must
    be very precarious. It is the general opinion of the
    inhabitants, that when a tiger has tasted human blood he
    prefers it to all other food. A year or two sometimes elapses
    without any one being killed by a tiger for several miles
    round, although they are often seen in that space, and are
    known to destroy cattle; but as soon as one man is killed,
    others shortly after share the same fate. This, I imagine, is
    the reason why the natives entertain an idea that they prefer
    men to all other food. I account for it otherwise. Tigers are
    naturally afraid of men, and, in the first instance, seldom
    attack them, unless compelled by extreme hunger. When once they
    have ventured an attack, they find them much easier prey than
    most animals of the forest, and always to be met with near
    villages, and on public roads, without the trouble of hunting
    about for them through the covers.</p>

    <p>A tigress with two cubs lurked about the <i>Kutkumsandy</i>
    pass, and during two months killed a man almost every day, and
    on some days two. Ten or twelve of the people belonging to
    government (carriers of the post-bags) were of the number. In
    fact, the communication between the Presidency and the upper
    provinces was almost entirely cut off. The government,
    therefore, was induced to offer a large reward to any person
    who killed the tigress.</p>

    <p>She was fired at, and, adds Mr. J., never ... "heard of
    after;" from which it may be presumed she was wounded. It is
    fortunate for the inhabitants of that country, that tigers
    seldom survive any wound; their blood being always in a state
    predisposing to putrefaction, consequence of the extreme heat,
    and their living entirely on animal food....</p>

    <p>Two <i>Biparies<a name="FNanchor1"></a></i><sup><a href=
    "#Footnote_1">[1]</a></sup> were driving a string of loaded
    bullocks to <i>Chittrah</i> from <i>Palamow</i>. When they were
    come within a few miles of the former place, a tiger seized on
    the man in the rear, which was seen by a <i>Guallah</i>
    [herdsman], as he was watching his buffaloes grazing. He boldly
    ran to the man's assistance, and cut the tiger severely with
    his sword; upon which he dropped the <i>Biparie</i> and seized
    the herdsman: the buffaloes observing it, attacked the tiger,
    and rescued the poor man; they tossed him about from one to the
    other, and, to the best of my recollection, killed him; but of
    that I am not quite positive. Both of the wounded men were
    brought to me. The <i>Biparie</i> recovered, and the herdsman
    died.</p>

    <p><a name="Footnote_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor1">[1]</a></p>

    <div class="note">
        &nbsp;<i>Bipar</i> signifies merchandise, and
        <i>Biparies</i> are people who buy grain, and other
        articles, which they transport from one part of the country
        to another on bullocks.<br>
        &nbsp;
    </div>An elderly man and his wife (of the lowest caste of
    <i>Hindoos</i>, called <i>dooms</i>, who live chiefly by making
    mats and baskets) were each carrying home a bundle of wood, and
    as they were resting their burdens on the ground, the old man
    hearing a strange noise, looked about, and saw a tiger running
    off with his wife in his mouth. He ran after them, and struck
    the tiger on the back with a small axe: the tiger dropt the
    wife, who was soon after brought to me. One of her breasts was
    almost entirely taken away, and the other much lacerated: she
    had also several deep wounds in the back of her neck, by which
    I imagine the tiger struck at her with his two fore paws; one
    on the neck, and the other on the breast. This, if I may judge
    from the number I have seen wounded, is their usual way of
    attacking men. The old woman was six months under my care, and
    at last recovered.

    <p>As an old Mahometan priest was travelling at mid-day on
    horseback, within a few miles of <i>Chittrah</i>, with his son,
    an athletic young man, walking by his side, they heard a tiger
    roaring near them. The son urged his father to hasten on; the
    old man continued at a slow pace, observing that there was no
    danger, the tiger would not molest them. He then began counting
    his beads, and offering his prayers to the Almighty; in the act
    of which he was knocked off his horse, and carried away by the
    tiger; the son ran after them, and cut the tiger with his
    sword; he dropped the father, seized the son, and carried him
    off. The father was brought to <i>Chittrah</i>, and died the
    same day; the son was never heard of afterwards. In this
    instance, I think, the tiger must have been ravenously hungry,
    or he would not have roared when near his prey; it is what they
    seldom or ever do, except in the very act of seizing....</p>

    <p>Some idea may be formed how numerous the tigers must have
    been at one period in Bengal, from the circumstance, that one
    gentleman is reported to have killed upwards of three hundred
    and sixty.</p>

    <a name="Death_of_Sir_John_Moore"></a>

    <h2><b>Death of Sir John Moore.</b></h2>

    <p>From Mr. Southey's History of the Peninsular War, a work of
    sterling merit.</p>

    <p>Marshal Soult's intention was to force the right of the
    British, and thus to interpose between Corunna and the army,
    and cut it off from the place of embarkation. Failing in this
    attempt, he was now endeavouring to outflank it. Half of the
    4th regiment was therefore ordered to fall back, forming an
    obtuse angle with the other half. This manoeuvre was
    excellently performed, and they commenced a heavy flanking
    fire: Sir John Moore called out to them, that this was exactly
    what he wanted to be done, and rode on to the 50th, commanded
    by Majors Napier and Stanhope. They got over an inclosure in
    their front, charged the enemy most gallantly, and drove them
    out of the village of Elvina; but Major Napier, advancing too
    far in the pursuit, received several wounds, and was made
    prisoner, and Major Stanhope was killed.</p>

    <p>The General now proceeded to the 42nd. "Highlanders," said
    he, "remember Egypt!" They rushed on, and drove the French
    before them, till they were stopped by a wall. Sir John
    accompanied them in this charge. He now sent Captain Hardinge
    to order up a battalion of Guards to the left flank of the
    42nd. The officer commanding the light infantry conceived at
    this that they were to be relieved by the Guards, because their
    ammunition was nearly expended, and he began to fall back. The
    General, discovering the mistake, said to them, "My brave 42nd,
    join your comrades: ammunition is coming, and you have your
    bayonets!" Upon this, they instantly moved forward. Captain
    Hardinge returned, and pointed out to the General where the
    Guards were advancing. The enemy kept up a hot fire, and their
    artillery played incessantly on the spot where they were
    standing. A cannon-shot struck Sir John, and carried away his
    left shoulder, and part of the collar-bone, leaving the arm
    hanging by the flesh. He fell from his horse on his back; his
    countenance did not change, neither did he betray the least
    sensation of pain. Captain Hardinge, who dismounted, and took
    him by the hand, observed him anxiously watching the 42nd,
    which was warmly engaged, and told him they were advancing; and
    upon that intelligence his countenance brightened. Colonel
    Graham, who now came up to assist him, seeing the composure of
    his features, began to hope that he was not wounded, till he
    perceived the dreadful laceration. From the size of the wound,
    it was in vain to make any attempt at stopping the blood; and
    Sir John consented to be removed in a blanket to the rear. In
    raising him up, his sword, hanging on the wounded side, touched
    his arm, and became entangled between his legs. Captain
    Hardinge began to unbuckle it; but the General said, in his
    usual tone and manner, and in a distinct voice, "It is as well
    as it is; I had rather it should go out of the field with me."
    Six soldiers of the 42nd and the Guards bore him. Hardinge,
    observing his composure, began to hope that the wound might not
    be mortal, and said to him, he trusted he might be spared to
    the army, and recover. Moore turned his head, and looking
    stedfastly at the wound for a few seconds, replied, "No,
    Hardinge, I feel that to be impossible."</p>

    <p>As the soldiers were carrying him slowly along, he made them
    frequently turn round, that he might see the field of battle,
    and listen to the firing; and he was well pleased when the
    sound grew fainter. A spring-wagon came up, bearing Colonel
    Wynch, who was wounded: the Colonel asked who was in the
    blanket, and being told it was Sir John Moore, wished him to be
    placed in the wagon. Sir John asked one of the Highlanders
    whether he thought the wagon or the blanket was best? and the
    man said the blanket would not shake him so much, as he and the
    other soldiers would keep the step, and carry him easy. So they
    proceeded with him to his quarters at Corunna, weeping as they
    went....</p>

    <p>The General lived to hear that the battle was won. "Are the
    French beaten?" was the question which he repeated to every one
    who came into his apartment; and he expressed how great a
    satisfaction it was to him to know that they were defeated. "I
    hope," he said, "the people of England will be satisfied! I
    hope my country will do me justice," Then, addressing Colonel
    Anderson, who had been his friend and companion in arms for
    one-and-twenty years, he said to him, "Anderson, you know that
    I have always wished to die this way--You will see my friends
    as soon as you can:--tell them everything--Say to my
    mother"--But here his voice failed, he became excessively
    agitated, and did not again venture to name her. Sometimes he
    asked to be placed in an easier posture. "I feel myself so
    strong," he said, "I fear I shall be long dying. It is great
    uneasiness--it is great pain." But, after a while, he pressed
    Anderson's hand close to his body, and, in a few minutes, died
    without a struggle. He fell, as it had ever been his wish to
    do, in battle and in victory. No man was more beloved in
    private life, nor was there any general in the British army so
    universally respected. All men had thought him worthy of the
    chief command. Had he been less circumspect,--had he looked
    more ardently forward, and less anxiously around him, and on
    all sides, and behind,--had he been more confident in himself
    and in his army, and impressed with less respect for the French
    Generals, he would have been more equal to the difficulties of
    his situation. Despondency was the radical weakness of his
    mind. Personally he was as brave a man as ever met death in the
    field; but he wanted faith in British courage: and it is faith
    by which miracles are wrought in war as well as in religion.
    But let it ever be remembered with gratitude, that, when some
    of his general officers advised him to conclude the retreat by
    a capitulation, Sir John Moore preserved the honour of
    England.</p>

    <p>He had often said that, if he were killed in battle, he
    wished to be buried where he fell. The body was removed at
    midnight to the citadel of Corunna. A grave was dug for him on
    the rampart there, by a party of the 9th regiment, the
    aides-du-camp attending by turns. No coffin could be procured;
    and the officers of his staff wrapped the body, dressed as it
    was, in a military cloak and blankets. The interment was
    hastened; for, about eight in the morning, some firing was
    heard, and they feared that, if a serious attack were made,
    they should be ordered away, and not suffered to pay him their
    last duty. The officers of his staff bore him to the grave; the
    funeral service was read by the chaplain; and the corpse was
    covered with earth.</p>

    <p>Thus, with a solemn splendour and a sad glory, closed the
    career of a gallant but unfortunate commander.</p>

    <h2><b>Persian Tyranny.</b></h2>

    <p>Sir R.K. Porter, in his travels in Persia, met with the
    sufferer from despotic tyranny and cruelty whose story is here
    related. He informs us, that the benignity of this person's
    countenance, united with the crippled state of his venerable
    frame, from the effects of his precipitation from the terrible
    height of execution, excited his curiosity to inquire into the
    particulars of so amazing a preservation.</p>

    <p>Entering into conversation on the amiable characters of the
    reigning royal family of Persia, and comparing the present
    happiness of his country under their rule, with its misery
    during the sanguinary usurpation of the tyrant Nackee Khan, the
    good old man, who had himself been so signal an example of that
    misery, was easily led to describe the extraordinary
    circumstances of his own case. Being connected with the last
    horrible acts, and consequent fall of the usurper, a double
    interest accompanied his recital, the substance of which was
    nearly as follows:--</p>

    <p>Having by intrigues and assassinations made himself master
    of the regal power at Shiraz, this monster of human kind found
    that the governor of Ispahan, instead of adhering to him, had
    proclaimed the accession of the lawful heir. No sooner was the
    intelligence brought to Nackee Khan than he put himself at the
    head of his troops, and set forward to revenge his contemned
    authority. When he arrived as far as Yezdikast, he encamped his
    army for a short halt, near the tomb on the north side. Being
    as insatiable of money as blood, he sent to the inhabitants of
    Yezdikast, and demanded an immense sum in gold, which he
    insisted should instantly be paid to his messengers. Unable to
    comply, the fact was respectfully pleaded in excuse; namely,
    "that all the money the city had possessed was already taken
    away by his own officers, and those of the opposite party; and
    that, at present, there was scarce a tomaun in the place."
    Enraged at this answer, he repaired, full of wrath, to the
    town, and, ordering eighteen of the principal inhabitants to be
    brought before him, again demanded the money, but with threats
    and imprecations which made the hearers tremble. Still,
    however, they could only return the same answer--"their utter
    inability to pay;" and the tyrant, without a moment's
    preparation, commanded the men to be seized, and hurled from
    the top of the precipice in his sight. Most of them were
    instantly killed on the spot; others, cruelly maimed, died in
    terrible agonies where they fell; and the describer of the
    dreadful scene was the only one who survived. He could form no
    idea of how long he lay after precipitation, utterly senseless;
    "but," added he, "by the will of God I breathed again; and, on
    opening my eyes, found myself among the dead and mangled bodies
    of my former neighbours and friends. Some yet groaned." He then
    related, that, in the midst of his horror at the sight, he
    heard sounds of yet more terrible acts, from the top of the
    cliff; and, momentarily strengthened by fear of he knew not
    what, for he believed that death had already grasped his own
    poor shattered frame, he managed to crawl away, unperceived,
    into one of the numerous caverned holes which perforate the
    foot of the steep. He lay there in an expiring state the whole
    night, but in the morning was providentially discovered by some
    of the town's people, who came to seek the bodies of their
    murdered relatives, to mourn over and take them away for
    burial. The poor man, feeble as he was, called to these weeping
    groups; who, to their astonishment and joy, drew out one
    survivor from the dreadful heap of slain. No time was lost in
    conveying him home, and administering every kind of assistance;
    but many months elapsed before he was able to move from his
    house, so deep had been the injuries inflicted in his fall.</p>

    <p>In the course of his awful narrative, he told us, that the
    noise which had so appalled him, as he lay among the
    blood-stained rocks, was indeed the acting of a new cruelty of
    the usurper. After having witnessed the execution of his
    sentence on the eighteen citizens, whose asseverations he had
    determined not to believe, Nackee Khan immediately sent for a
    devout man, called Saied Hassan, who was considered the sage of
    the place, and, for his charities, greatly beloved by the
    people. "This man," said the Khan, "being a descendant of the
    Prophet, must know the truth, and will tell it me. He shall
    find me those who can and will pay the money." But the answer
    given by the honest Saied being precisely the same with that of
    the innocent victims who had already perished, the tyrant's
    fury knew no bounds, and, rising from his seat, he ordered the
    holy man to be rent asunder in his presence, and then thrown
    over the rock, to increase the monument of his vengeance
    below.</p>

    <p>It was the tumult of this most dreadful execution, which
    occasioned the noise that drove the affrighted narrator to the
    shelter of any hole from the eye of merciless man. But the
    cruel scene did not end here. Even in the yet sensible ear of
    the Saied, expiring in agonies, his execrable murderer ordered
    that his wife and daughters should be given up to the soldiers;
    and that, in punishment of such universal rebellion in the
    town, the whole place should be razed to the ground. But this
    last act of blood on a son of the Prophet cost the perpetrator
    his life. For the soldiers themselves, and the nobles who had
    been partisans of the usurper, were so struck with horror at
    the sacrilegious murder, and appalled with the threatened guilt
    of violating women of the sacred family, that they believed a
    curse must follow the abettors of such a man. The next step, in
    their minds, was to appease Heaven by the immolation of the
    offender; and, in the course of that very night, a band of his
    servants cut the cords of his tent, which, instantly falling in
    upon him, afforded them a secure opportunity of burying their
    poniards in his body. The first strokes were followed by
    thousands. So detested was the wretch, that in a few minutes
    his remains were hewn and torn to pieces. It does not become
    men to lift the veil which lies over the whole doom of a
    ruthless murderer; but there is something in the last mortal
    yell of a tyrant, whether it be a Robespierre or a Nackee Khan,
    which sounds as if mingled with a dreadful echo from the
    eternal shore.</p>

    <p>The Rock Bridge is described by Mr. Jefferson, late
    President of the United States, as one of the most sublime of
    the productions of Nature. It is on the ascent of a hill which
    seems to have been cloven through its length by some great
    convulsion of Nature.</p>

    <p>Although the sides of the bridge are provided in some parts
    with a parapet of fixed rocks, yet few persons have resolution
    to walk to them, and look over into the abyss. The passenger
    involuntarily falls on his hands, creeps to the parapet, and
    peeps over it. Looking down from this height for the space of a
    minute, occasions a violent headache; and the view from beneath
    is delightful in the extreme, as much as that from above is
    exquisitely painful.</p>

    <p>The following beautiful sketch is from the pen of the Rev.

    <h3>ROCK BRIDGE.</h3>

    <p>On a lovely morning towards the close of spring, I found
    myself in a very beautiful part of the great valley of
    Virginia. Spurred on by impatience, I beheld the sun rising in
    splendour, and changing the blue tints on the tops of the lofty
    Alleghany mountains into streaks of purest gold; and nature
    seemed to smile in the freshness of beauty. A ride of about
    fifteen miles, and a pleasant woodland ramble of about two,
    brought myself and my companion to the great NATURAL
    BRIDGE.</p>

    <p>Although I had been anxiously looking forward to this time,
    and my mind had been considerably excited by expectation, yet I
    was not altogether prepared for this visit. This great work of
    nature is considered by many as the second great curiosity in
    our country, Niagara Falls being the first. I do not expect to
    convey a very correct idea of this bridge; for no description
    can do this.</p>

    <p>The Natural Bridge is entirely the work of God. It is of
    solid limestone, and connects two huge mountains together, by a
    most beautiful arch over which there is a great wagon road. Its
    length from one mountain to the other is nearly eighty feet,
    its width about thirty-five, its thickness forty-five, and its
    perpendicular height above the water is not far from two
    hundred and twenty feet. A few bushes grow on its top, by which
    the traveller may hold himself as he looks over. On each side
    of the stream, and near the bridge, are rocks projecting ten or
    fifteen feet over the water, and from two hundred to three
    hundred feet from its surface, all of limestone. The visitor
    cannot give so good a description of the bridge as he can of
    his feelings at the time. He softly creeps out on a shaggy
    projecting rock, and, looking down a chasm from forty to sixty
    feet wide, he sees, nearly three hundred feet below, a wild
    stream foaming and dashing against the rocks beneath, as if
    terrified at the rocks above. This stream is called Cedar
    Creek. He sees under the arch, trees whose height is seventy
    feet; and yet, as he looks down upon them, they appear like
    small bushes of perhaps two or three feet in height. I saw
    several birds fly under the arch, and they looked like insects.
    I threw down a stone, and counted thirty-four before it reached
    the water. All hear of heights and of depths, but they here
    <i>see</i> what is high, and they tremble, and <i>feel</i> it
    to be deep. The awful rocks present their everlasting butments,
    the water murmurs and foams far below, and the two mountains
    rear their proud heads on each side, separated by a channel of
    sublimity. Those who view the sun, the moon, and the stars, and
    allow that none but God could make them, will here be impressed
    that none but an <i>Almighty</i> God could build a bridge like
    this.</p>

    <p>The view of the bridge from below is as pleasing as the top
    view is awful. The arch from beneath would seem to be about two
    feet in thickness. Some idea of the distance from the top to
    the bottom may be formed, from the fact, that as I stood on the
    bridge and my companion beneath, neither of us could speak
    sufficiently loud to be heard by the other. A man, from either
    view, does not appear more than four or five inches in
    height.</p>

    <p>As we stood under this beautiful arch, we saw the place
    where visitors have often taken the pains to engrave their
    names upon the rock. Here Washington climbed up twenty-five
    feet, and carved his own name, where it still remains. Some,
    wishing to immortalise their names, have engraven them deep and
    large, while others have tried to climb up and insert them high
    in this book of fame.</p>

    <p>A few years since, a young man, being ambitious to place his
    name above all others, was very near losing his life in the
    attempt. After much fatigue he climbed up as high as possible,
    but found that the person who had before occupied his place was
    taller than himself, and consequently had placed his name above
    his reach. But he was not thus to be discouraged. He opened a
    large jack-knife, and, in the soft limestone, began to cut
    places for his hands and feet. With much patience and industry
    he worked his way upwards, and succeeded in carving his name
    higher than the most ambitious had done before him. He could
    now triumph, but his triumph was short; for he was placed in
    such a situation that it was impossible to descend, unless he
    fell upon the ragged rocks beneath him. There was no house
    near, from whence his companions could get assistance. He could
    not long remain in that condition, and, what was worse, his
    friends were too much frightened to do anything for his relief.
    They looked upon him as already dead, expecting every moment to
    see him precipitated upon the rocks below and dashed to pieces.
    Not so with himself. He determined to ascend. Accordingly he
    plies the rock with his knife, cutting places for his hands and
    feet, and gradually ascended with incredible labour. He exerts
    every muscle. His life was at stake, and all the terrors of
    death rose before him. He dared not look downwards, lest his
    head should become dizzy; and perhaps on this circumstance his
    life depended. His companions stood at the top of the rock,
    exhorting and encouraging him. His strength was almost
    exhausted; but a bare possibility of saving his life still
    remained; and hope, the last friend of the distressed, had not
    yet forsaken him. His course upwards was rather oblique than
    perpendicular. His most critical moment had now arrived. He had
    ascended considerably more than two hundred feet, and had still
    further to rise, when he felt himself fast growing weak. He
    thought of his friends, and all his earthly joys, and he could
    not leave them. He thought of the grave, and dared not meet it.
    He now made his last effort and succeeded. He had cut his way
    not far from two hundred and fifty feet from the water, in a
    course almost perpendicular; and in a little less than two
    hours, his anxious companions reached him a pole from the top,
    and drew him up. They received him with shouts of joy, but he
    himself was completely exhausted. He immediately fainted on
    reaching the top, and it was some time before he could be
    recovered!</p>

    <p>It was interesting to see the path up these awful rocks, and
    to follow in imagination this bold youth as he thus saved his
    life. His name stands far above all the rest, a monument of
    hardihood, of rashness, and of folly.</p>

    <p>We lingered around this seat of grandeur about four hours;
    but, from my own feelings, I should not have supposed it over
    half an hour. There is a little cottage near, lately built;
    here we were desired to write our names, as visitors of the
    bridge, in a large book kept for this purpose. Two large
    volumes were nearly filled in this manner already. Having
    immortalised our names by enrolling them in this book, we
    slowly and silently returned to our horses, wondering at this
    great work of nature; and we could not but be filled with
    astonishment at the amazing power of Him who can clothe Himself
    in wonder and terror, or throw around His works a mantle of
    sublimity.</p>

    <a name="WIER'S_CAVE"></a>

    <h3>WIER'S CAVE.</h3>

    <p>About three days' ride from the Natural Bridge brought Mr.
    Todd and his companions to a place called Port Republic, about
    twenty miles from the town of Staunton. Here they prepared
    themselves to visit this other natural curiosity.</p>

    <p>The shower was now over, which had wet us to the skin--the
    sun was pouring down his most scorching rays--the heavy thunder
    had gone by; we threw around our delighted eyes, and beheld
    near us the lofty Alleghany rearing his shaggy head. The south
    branch of the Shenandoah river, with its banks covered with
    beautiful trees, was murmuring at our feet--a lovely plain
    stretched below us, as far as the eye could reach; and we, with
    our guide, were now standing about half way up a hill nearly
    two hundred feet high, and so steep that a biscuit may be
    thrown from its top into the river at its foot--we were
    standing at the mouth of WIER'S CAVE. This cavern derives its
    name from <i>Barnet Wier</i>, who discovered it in the year
    1804. It is situated near Madison's Cave, so celebrated; though
    the latter cannot be compared with the former.</p>

    <p>There were three of us, besides our guide, with lighted
    torches, and our loins girded, now ready to descend into the
    cave. We took our torches in our left hands and entered. The
    mouth was so small that we could descend only by creeping, one
    after another. A descent of almost twenty yards brought us into
    the first room. The cave was exceedingly cold, dark, and
    silent, like the chambers of death. In this manner we
    proceeded, now descending thirty or forty feet--now ascending
    as high--now creeping on our hands and knees, and now walking
    in large rooms--the habitations of solitude. The mountain seems
    to be composed almost wholly of limestone, and by this means
    the cave is lined throughout with the most beautiful
    incrustations and stalactites of carbonated lime, which are
    formed by the continual dripping of the water through the roof.
    These stalactites are of various and elegant shapes and
    colours, often bearing a striking resemblance to animated
    nature. At one place we saw over our heads what appeared to be
    a <i>waterfall</i> of the most beautiful kind. Nor could the
    imagination be easily persuaded that it was not a reality. You
    could see the water boiling and dashing down,--see its white
    spray and foam--but it was all solid limestone.</p>

    <p>Thus we passed onward in this world of solitude--now
    stopping to admire the beauties of a single stalactite--now
    wondering at the magnificence of a large room--now creeping
    through narrow passages, hardly wide enough to admit the body
    of a man,--and now walking in superb galleries, until we came
    to the largest room, called WASHINGTON HALL. This is certainly
    the most elegant room I ever saw. It is about two hundred and
    seventy feet in length, about thirty-five in width, and between
    thirty and forty feet high. The roof and sides are very
    beautifully adorned by the tinsels which Nature has bestowed in
    the greatest profusion, and which sparkle like the diamond,
    while surveyed by the light of torches. The floor is flat, and
    smooth, and solid. I was foremost of our little party in
    entering the room, and was not a little startled as I
    approached the centre, to see a figure, as it were, rising up
    before me out of the solid rock. It was not far from seven feet
    high, and corresponded in every respect to the common idea of a
    ghost. It was very white, and resembled a tall man clothed in a
    shroud. I went up to it sideways, though I could not really
    expect to meet a ghost in a place like this. On examination I
    found it was a very beautiful piece of the carbonate of lime,
    very transparent, and very much in the shape of a man. This is
    called WASHINGTON'S STATUE--as if Nature would do for this hero
    what his delivered country has not done--rear a statue to his
    memory.</p>

    <p>Here an accident happened which might have been serious. One
    of our party had purposely extinguished his light, lest we
    should not have enough to last. My companion accidentally put
    out his light, and in sport came and blew out mine. We were now
    about sixteen hundred feet from daylight, with but one feeble
    light, which the falling water might in a moment have
    extinguished. Add to this, that the person who held this light
    was at some distance viewing some falling water.<br>
    "Conticuere omnes, intentique ora tenebant."</p>

    <p>We, however, once more lighted our torches; but, had we not
    been able to do so, we might, at our leisure, have contemplated
    the gloominess of the cavern, for no one would have come to us
    till the next day. In one room we found an excellent spring of
    water, which boiled up as if to slake our thirst, then sunk
    into the mountain, and was seen no more. In another room was a
    noble pillar, called the TOWER OF BABEL. It is composed
    entirely of stalactites of lime, or, as the appearance would
    seem to suggest, of petrified water. It is about thirty feet in
    diameter, and a little more than ninety feet in circumference,
    and not far from thirty feet high. There are probably millions
    of stalactites in this one pillar.</p>

    <p>Thus we wandered on in this world within a world, till we
    had visited twelve very beautiful rooms, and as many creeping
    places, and had now arrived at the end,--a distance from our
    entrance of between twenty-four and twenty-five hundred feet;
    or, what is about its equal, half a mile from the mouth. We
    here found ourselves exceedingly fatigued; but our torches
    forbade us to tarry, and we once more turned our lingering
    steps towards the common world. When we arrived again at
    Washington Hall, one of our company three times discharged a
    pistol, whose report was truly deafening; and as the sound
    reverberated and echoed through one room after another till it
    died away in distance, it seemed like the moanings of spirits.
    We continued our wandering steps till we arrived once more at
    daylight, having been nearly three hours in the cavern. We were
    much fatigued, covered with dirt, and in a cold sweat; yet we
    regretted to leave it. From the farther end of the cave I
    gathered some handsome stalactites, which I put into my
    portmanteau, and preserved as mementos of that day's visit.</p>

    <p>To compare the Natural Bridge and Cave together as objects
    of curiosity, is exceedingly difficult. Many consider the
    <i>Bridge</i> as the greatest curiosity; but I think the
    <i>Cavern</i> is. In looking at the Bridge we are filled with
    awe; at the Cavern with delight. At the Bridge we have several
    views that are awful; at the Cave hundreds that are pleasing.
    At the Bridge you stand and gaze in astonishment; at the Cave
    awfulness is lost in beauty, and grandeur is dressed in a
    thousand captivating forms. At the Bridge you feel yourself to
    be <i>looking</i> into another world; at the Cave you find
    yourself already <i>arrived</i> there. The one presents to us a
    God who is very "wonderful in working;" the other exhibits the
    same power, but with it is blended loveliness in a thousand
    forms. In each is vastness. Greatness constitutes the whole of
    one; but the other is elegant, as well as great. Of each we
    must retain lively impressions; and to witness such displays of
    the Creator's power, must ever be considered as happy events in
    our lives. While viewing scenes like these, we must ever exalt
    the energy of creating power, and sink under the thoughts of
    our own insignificance. The works of nature are admirably well
    calculated to impress us deeply with a sense of the mighty
    power of God, who can separate two mountains by a channel of
    awfulness, or fill the bowels of a huge mountain with beauties,
    that man, with all the aid of art, can only admire, but never

    <h2><b>The Christian Slave.</b></h2>

    <p>We venture to extract another of Mr. Todd's Simple Sketches,
    so charmingly are they described.</p>

    <p>The sun had set, and I began to be anxious to find a place
    of rest for the night, after a day's ride under a sultry sun. I
    was travelling in South Carolina, and was now not far from a
    branch of the Cooper river. The country here is a dead level,
    and its surface is covered with thinly scattered pines. I came
    to an old church--it stood solitary; not a house in sight: it
    was built of wood, and much decayed. The breezes of evening
    were gently sighing through the tops of the long-leaved pines
    which stood near; while still nearer stood several large
    live-oaks, which spread out their aged arms, as if to shelter
    what was sacred. On their limbs hung, in graceful folds, the
    long grey moss, as if a mantle of mourning, waving over a few
    decayed tombs at the east side of the church. These oaks give
    the place a very sombre and awful appearance; they seemed to
    stand as silent mourners over the dust of generations that had
    sunk into the grave, and waiting in solemn expectation that
    others would soon come and lie beneath their shade in the long
    sleep of death. The time of day, and the sacredness of the
    spot, were so congenial to my own feelings, that I
    involuntarily stopped my horse.</p>

    <p>My curiosity was now excited by seeing a very aged negro
    standing and gazing steadily on a small decaying tomb. He
    seemed to be intent, and did not observe me; his woolly locks
    were whitened by age; his countenance was manly, though it bore
    the marks of sorrow; he was leaning on his smooth-worn staff,
    the companion of many years. I was somewhat surprised on seeing
    this aged African silently meditating among the vestiges of the
    dead, and accordingly roused him from his reverie. He started
    at first, but his confidence was soon gained. There is a spring
    in the bosom of every Christian, which throws a joy into his
    heart whenever he meets a fellow-christian during his
    pilgrimage here below. I found the old negro to be an eminent
    Christian, and we were soon acquainted. I inquired what motive
    induced him, at that hour of the day, to visit these tombs.
    Instead of answering my question directly he gave me the
    following account of himself, in broken language:--</p>

    <p>About sixty years ago, this negro was living under his
    paternal roof in Africa. He was the son of a chief of a small
    tribe, the pride of his parents, and the delight of his
    countrymen; none could more dexterously throw the dart; none
    more skilfully guide the fragile canoe over the bosom of the
    deep. He was not far from twenty years of age, when, on a fair
    summer's morn, he went in his little canoe to spend the day in
    fishing. About noon he paddled his bark to the shore, and,
    under the shade of a beautiful palmetto-tree, he reclined till
    the heat of noon-day should be passed. He was young, healthy,
    and active; he knew none whom he dreaded; he was a stranger to
    fear, and he dreamed only of security, as he slept under the
    shade of his own native tree. Thus, while our sky is encircled
    with the bow of happiness, we forget that it may soon be
    overspread with darkness. When this African awoke, he found his
    hands bound behind him, his feet fettered, and himself
    surrounded by several white men, who were conveying him on
    board of their ship;--it was a slave-ship. The vessel had her
    cargo completed, and was ready to sail. As they were unfurling
    the sails, the son of Africa, with many others of his
    countrymen, for the last time cast his eyes upon his native
    shores. Futurity was dark,--was uncertain,--was despair. His
    bosom thrilled with anguish, as he threw his last farewell look
    over the plains of his native country. There was his native
    spot where his had lived, there the home of his infancy and
    childhood, there the place where he had inhaled his earliest
    breath--and to tear him from these, seemed like breaking the
    very strings of his heart.</p>

                width="548">
    </center>

    <p>After a melancholy passage, during which the African was
    forced to wear double the irons to receive double the number of
    lashes, that any of his companions received, on account of his
    refractory spirit, he was at length landed and sold to a
    planter in the place where he now resides. There is nothing
    new, nothing novel or interesting, that ever takes place in the
    life of a slave--describe one day, and you write the history of
    a slave. The sun, indeed, continues to roll over him; but it
    sheds upon him no new joys, no new prospects, no new hopes. So
    it was with the subject of this narrative. His master was
    naturally a man of a very humane disposition; but his overseers
    were often little else than compounds of vice and cruelty. In
    this situation the negro lost all his natural independence and
    bravery. He often attempted to run away, but was as often taken
    and punished. Having no cultivated mind to which he could look
    for consolation--knowing of no change that was ever to take
    place in his situation,--he settled down in gloominess. Often
    would he send a silent sigh for the home of his youth; but his
    path shewed but few marks of happiness, and few rays of hope
    for futurity were drawn by fancy's hand. Sunk in despondency
    and vice, he was little above the brutes around him.</p>

    <p>In this situation he was accidentally met by the good
    minister of the parish, who addressed him as a rational and
    immortal being, and pressed upon him the first principles of
    religion. This was a new subject; for he had never before
    looked beyond the narrow bounds before him, nor had he ever
    dreamed of a world beyond this. After a long conversation on
    this subject, the minister made him promise that he would now
    "<i>attend to his soul</i>."</p>

    <p>The clergyman could not, for many months after this, obtain
    an interview with his new pupil, who most carefully shunned
    him. But though afraid to meet his minister, he still felt an
    arrow of conviction in his heart. Wherever he went, whether
    asleep or awake, to use his own words, his promise, "me take
    care of soul, stick close to him," He now began in earnest to
    seek "the one thing needful". By the kindness of his master he
    learned to read his Testament, and to inquire more about Jesus.
    He was now very desirous to see his minister; and before a
    convenient opportunity occurred, he was in such distress of
    mind as actually to attempt two several times to kill himself.
    His minister visited him, conversed and prayed with him.</p>

    <p>"<i>Oh</i>," he would say, "God never think such poor negro,
    he no love so much sinner, he no before ever see such bad
    heart!" The mercy of Christ, and his compassion towards
    sinners, were explained to him, and his soul was filled with
    "joy and peace in believing," He now rejoiced and thanked God
    that he was brought from his native shores, as he had a fairer
    country, and purer enjoyments presented to his view, after the
    scenes of this transitory world shall be over. He now became
    more industrious and more faithful. By uncommon industry he
    raised money sufficient to purchase his own freedom. He next
    bought the liberty of his wife, and had nearly completed paying
    for that of his only daughter, when she was liberated by the
    hand of death. His wife soon followed her, and left this world
    a perfect void to the husband and father. His every tie that
    bound him to earth was now broken. Having no earthly enjoyment,
    he now placed his affections on heaven above. It is easy for
    the Christian to make rapid progress in holiness when not
    fettered by worldly cares.</p>

    <p>It was now dark, and I must leave my new acquaintance. I
    left him with his face wet with tears, still standing beside
    the tomb--the tomb of his old minister! This good man had been
    his faithful and constant guide, and though his ashes had been
    slumbering for years, the negro had not yet forgotten how to
    weep at their urn. I could not but admire the wonderful
    dealings of God, in order to bring men to himself. Happy
    minister! who hast been the instrument of covering a multitude
    of sins! Happy negro! his is not this world. Though no
    sculptured marble may tell the traveller where he may shortly
    lie--though he never trod the thorny road of ambition or
    power--though the trumpet of fame never blew the echo of his
    name through a gaping world--still those eyes, which will soon
    be closed in death, may hereafter awake, to behold, undaunted,
    a world in flames, and these heavens fleeing away.</p>

    <h2><b>Violent Earthquake in Calabria.</b></h2>

    <p>In nature there is nothing which can inspire us with so much
    awe as those violent outbreakings which occasionally convulse
    the earth, creating fearful devastation, overthrowing cities,
    and destroying much life and property. The following is a
    description of one which occurred in Calabria and Sicily in the
    year 1783; and which, from its violence, overthrew many cities,
    creating an universal consternation in the minds of the
    inhabitants of the two kingdoms.</p>

    <p>On Wednesday, the fifth of February, about one in the
    afternoon, the earth was convulsed in that part of Calabria
    which is bounded by the rivers of Gallico and Metramo, by the
    mountains Jeio, Sagra, and Caulone, and the coast between these
    rivers and the Tuscan Sea. This district is called the
    <i>Piana</i>, because the country extends itself from the roots
    of the Appenines, in a plain, for twenty Italian miles in
    length by eighteen in breadth. The earthquake lasted about a
    hundred seconds. It was felt as far as Otranto, Palermo,
    Lipari, and the other &AElig;olian isles; a little also in
    Apuglia, and the <i>Terra di Cavoro</i>; in Naples and the
    Abruzzi not at all. There stood in this plain a hundred and
    nine cities and villages, the habitations of a hundred and
    sixty-six thousand human beings; and in less than two minutes
    all these edifices were destroyed, with nearly thirty-two
    thousand individuals of every age, sex, and station,--the rich
    equally with the poor; for there existed no power of escaping
    from so sudden a destruction. The soil of the <i>Piana</i> was
    granite at the base of the Apennines, but in the plain the
    <i>debris</i> of every sort of earth, brought down from the
    mountains by the rains, constituted a mass of unequal solidity,
    resistance, weight, and form. On this account, whatever might
    have been the cause of the earthquake, whether volcanic or
    electrical, the movement assumed every possible
    direction--vertical, horizontal, oscillatory, vorticose, and
    pulsatory; producing every variety of destruction. In one
    place, a city or house was thrown down, in another it was
    immersed. Here, trees were buried to their topmost branches,
    beside others stripped and overturned. Some mountains opened in
    the middle, and dispersed their mass to the right and left,
    their summits disappearing, or being lost in the newly-formed
    valleys; others slipped from their foundations along with all
    their edifices, which sometimes were overthrown, but more
    rarely remained uninjured, and the inhabitants not even
    disturbed in their sleep. The earth opened in many places,
    forming frightful abysses; while, at a small distance, it rose
    into hills. The waters, too, changed their course; rivers
    uniting to form lakes, or spreading into marshes; disappearing,
    to rise again in new streams, through other banks, or running
    at large, to lay bare and desolate the most fertile fields.
    Nothing retained its ancient form, cities, roads, and
    boundaries vanished,--so that the inhabitants were bewildered
    as if in an unknown land. The works of art and of nature, the
    elaborations of centuries, together with many a stream and
    rock, coeval perhaps with the world itself, were in a single
    instant destroyed and overthrown.... Whirlwinds, tempests, the
    flames of volcanoes, and of burning edifices, rain, wind, and
    thunder, accompanied the movements of the earth: all the forces
    of nature were in activity, and it seemed as if all its laws
    were suspended, and the last hour of created things at hand. In
    the meantime, the sea between Scylla, Charybdis, and the coasts
    of Reggio and Messina, was raised many fathoms above its usual
    level; overflowing its banks, and then, in its return to its
    channel, carrying away men and beasts. By these means, two
    thousand persons lost their lives on Scylla alone, who were
    either congregated on the sands, or had escaped in boats, from
    the dangers of the dry land. Etna and Stromboli were in more
    than usual activity: but this hardly excited attention, amidst
    greater and graver disasters. A worse fire than that of the
    volcanoes resulted from the incidents of the earthquake; for
    the beams of the falling houses being ignited by the burning
    heaths, the flames, fanned by the winds, were so vast and
    fierce, that they seemed to issue from the bosom of the earth.
    The heavens, alternately cloudy or serene, had given no
    previous sign of the approaching calamity; but a new source of
    suffering followed it, in a thick fog, which obscured the light
    of the day, and added to the darkness of night. Irritating to
    the eyes, injurious to the respiration, fetid, and immoveable,
    it hung over the two Calabrias for more than twenty days,--an
    occasion of melancholy, disease, and annoyance, both to man and
    to animals....</p>

    <p>At the first shock, no token, in heaven or on earth, had
    excited attention; but at the sudden movement, and at the
    aspect of destruction, an overwhelming terror seized on the
    general mind, insomuch, that the instinct of self-preservation
    was suspended, and men remained thunderstricken and immoveable.
    On the return of reason, the first sentiment was a sort of joy
    at the partial escape; but they soon gave place to grief for
    the loss of family, and the overthrow of the domestic
    habitation. Amidst so many aspects of death, and the
    apprehension even of approaching judgment, the suspicion that
    friends were yet alive under the ruins was the most
    excruciating affliction, since the impossibility of assisting
    them rendered their death--(miserable and terrible
    consolation)--a matter of preference and of hope. Fathers and
    husbands were seen wandering amidst the ruins that covered the
    objects of their affections, and, wanting the power to move the
    superincumbent masses, were calling in vain for the assistance
    of the bystanders; or haply they lay groaning, night and day,
    in their despair, upon the ruinous fragments. But the most
    horrid fate--(a fate too dreadful to conceive or to
    relate)--was theirs, who, buried alive beneath the fallen
    edifices, awaited, with an anxious and doubtful hope, the
    chances of relief--accusing, at first, the slowness, and then
    the avarice, of their dearest relations and friends; and when
    they sank under hunger and grief--with their senses and memory
    beginning to fail them--their last sentiment was that of
    indignation against their kindred, and hatred of humanity. Many
    were disinterred alive by their friends, and some by the
    earthquake itself; which, overthrowing the very ruins it had
    made, restored them to light. It was ultimately found, that
    about a fourth of those whose bodies were recovered, might have
    been saved, had timely assistance been at hand. The men were
    chiefly found in attitudes indicating an effort at escape, the
    women with their hands covering their face, or desperately
    plunged in their hair. Mothers were discovered dead who had
    striven to protect their infants with their own bodies, or lay
    with their arms stretched towards these objects of affection,
    when separated from them by intervening masses of ruin.</p>

    <h2><b>Escape from a Ship on Fire.</b></h2>

    <p>From the "Missionary Annual" for 1833.</p>

    <p>Many of the party, having retired to their hammocks soon
    after the commencement of the storm, were only partially
    clothed, when they made their escape; but the seamen on the
    watch, in consequence of the heavy rain, having cased
    themselves in double or treble dresses, supplied their
    supernumerary articles of clothing to those who had none. We
    happily succeeded in bringing away two compasses from the
    binnacle, and a few candles from the cuddy-table, one of them
    lighted; one bottle of wine, and another of porter, were handed
    to us, with the tablecloth and a knife, which proved very
    useful; but the fire raged so fiercely in the body of the
    vessel, that neither bread nor water could be obtained. The
    rain still poured in torrents; the lightning, followed by loud
    bursting of thunder, continued to stream from one side of the
    heavens to the other,--one moment dazzling us by its glare, and
    the next moment leaving us in darkness, relieved only by the
    red flames of the conflagration from which we were endeavouring
    to escape. Our first object was to proceed to a distance from
    the vessel, lest she should explode and overwhelm us; but, to
    our inexpressible distress, we discovered that the yawl had no
    rudder, and that for the two boats we had only three oars. All
    exertions to obtain more from the ship proved unsuccessful. The
    gig had a rudder; from this they threw out a rope to take us in
    tow; and, by means of a few paddles, made by tearing up the
    lining of the boat, we assisted in moving ourselves slowly
    through the water, providentially the sea was comparatively
    smooth, or our overloaded boats would have swamped, and we
    should only have escaped the flames to have perished in the
    deep. The wind was light, but variable, and, acting on the
    sails, which, being drenched with the rain, did not soon take
    fire, drove the burning mass, in terrific grandeur, over the
    surface of the ocean, the darkness of which was only
    illuminated by the quick glancing of the lightning or the glare
    of the conflagration. Our situation was for some time extremely
    perilous. The vessel neared us more than once, and apparently
    threatened to involve us in one common destruction. The cargo,
    consisting of dry provisions, spirits, cotton goods, and other
    articles equally combustible, burned with great violence, while
    the fury of the destroying element, the amazing height of the
    flames, the continued storm, amidst the thick darkness of the
    night, rendered the scene appalling and terrible. About ten
    o'clock, the masts, after swaying from side to side, fell with
    a dreadful crash into the sea, and the hull of the vessel
    continued to burn amidst the shattered fragments of the wreck,
    till the sides were consumed to the water's edge. The spectacle
    was truly magnificent, could it even have been contemplated by
    us without a recollection of our own circumstances. The
    torments endured by the dogs, sheep, and other animals on
    board, at any other time would have excited our deepest
    commiseration; but at present, the object before us, our
    stately ship, that had for the last four months been our social
    home, the scene of our enjoyments, our labours, and our rest,
    now a prey to the destroying element; the suddenness with which
    we had been hurried from circumstances of comfort and
    comparative security, to those of destitution and peril, and
    with which the most exhilarating hopes had been exchanged for
    disappointment as unexpected as it was afflictive; the sudden
    death of the two seamen, our own narrow escape, and lonely
    situation on the face of the deep, and the great probability
    even yet, although we had succeeded in removing to a greater
    distance from the vessel, that we ourselves should never again
    see the light of day, or set foot on solid ground, absorbed
    every feeling. For some time the silence was scarcely broken,
    and the thoughts of many, I doubt not, were engaged on subjects
    most suitable to immortal beings on the brink of eternity. The
    number of persons in the two boats was forty-eight; and all,
    with the exception of the two ladies, who bore this severe
    visitation with uncommon fortitude, worked by turns at the oars
    and paddles. After some time, to our great relief, the rain
    ceased; the labour of baling water from the boats was then
    considerably diminished. We were frequently hailed during the
    night by our companions in the small boat, and returned the
    call, while the brave and generous-hearted seamen occasionally
    enlivened the solitude of the deep by a simultaneous "Hurra!"
    to cheer each others' labours, and to animate their spirits.
    The Tanjore rose in the water as its contents were gradually
    consumed. We saw it burning the whole night, and at day-break
    could distinguish a column of smoke, which, however, soon
    ceased, and every sign of our favourite vessel disappeared.
    When the sun rose, our anxiety and uncertainty as to our
    situation were greatly relieved by discovering land ahead; the
    sight of it filled us with grateful joy, and nerved us with
    fresh vigour for the exertion required in managing the boats.
    With the advance of the day we discerned more clearly the
    nature of the country. It was wild and covered with jungle,
    without any appearance of population: could we have got ashore,
    therefore, many of us might have perished before assistance
    could have been procured; but the breakers, dashing upon the
    rocks, convinced us that landing was impracticable. In the
    course of the morning we discovered a native vessel, or dhoney,
    lying at anchor, at some distance: the wind at that time
    beginning to favour us, every means was devised to render it
    available. In the yawl we extended the tablecloth as a sail,
    and in the other boat a blanket served the same purpose. This
    additional help was the more seasonable, as the rays of the sun
    had become almost intolerable to our partially covered bodies.
    Some of the seamen attempted to quench their thirst by salt
    water: but the passengers encouraged each other to abstain.
    About noon we reached the dhoney. The natives on board were
    astonished and alarmed at our appearance, and expressed some
    unwillingness to receive us; but our circumstances would admit
    of no denial; and we scarcely waited till our Singalese
    fellow-passenger could interpret to them our situation and our
    wants, before we ascended the sides of their vessel, assuring
    them that every expense and loss sustained on our account
    should be amply repaid.</p>

    whose life has been one of wandering and peril, traversing
    every quarter of the globe. The account of his residence for

    the Island of Tristan d'Acunha, upon which, by accident, he was

    <h3>THE ALBATROSS.</h3>

    <p>Being a fine morning, I determined to ascend the mountain.
    As several parties had before gone up, they had formed a kind
    of path: at least we endeavoured to trace the same way; but it
    requires a great deal of nerve to attempt it. The sides of the
    mountain are nearly perpendicular; but, after ascending about
    two hundred feet, it is there entirely covered with wood, which
    renders the footing much more safe; but in order to get to the
    wood, the road is so dangerous, that it made me almost tremble
    to think of it,--slippery grey rocks, and many of them
    unfortunately loose, so that when we took hold, they separated
    from the mass, and fell with a horrid rumbling noise. Here and
    there were a few patches of grass, the only thing we could
    depend upon to assist us in climbing, which must be done with
    extreme caution, for the least slip or false step would dash
    one to atoms on the rocks below. By keeping our eyes constantly
    looking upwards, and continuing to haul ourselves up, by
    catching firm hold on this grass, after an hour's painful toil
    we gained the summit, where we found ourselves on an extended
    plain, of several miles expanse, which terminates in the peak,
    composed of dark grey lava, bare and frightful to behold. We
    proceeded towards it, the plain gradually rising, but the
    walking was most fatiguing, over strong rank grass and fern
    several feet high, with holes concealed under the roots in such
    a way, that no possible caution could prevent our occasionally
    falling down into one or other of them, and entirely
    disappearing, which caused a boisterous laugh amongst the rest;
    but it frequently happened, while one was making merry at the
    expense of another, down sunk the laugher himself. A death-like
    stillness prevailed in these high regions, and, to my ear, our
    voices had a strange, unnatural echo, and I fancied our forms
    appeared gigantic, whilst the air was piercing cold. The
    prospect was altogether very sublime, and filled the mind with
    awe! On the one side, the boundless horizon, heaped up with
    clouds of silvery brightness, contrasted with some of darker
    hue, enveloping us in their vapour, and, passing rapidly away,
    gave us only casual glances of the landscape; and, on the other
    hand, the sterile and cindery peak, with its venerable head,
    partly capped with clouds, partly revealing great patches of
    red cinders, or lava, intermingled with the black rock,
    produced a most extraordinary and dismal effect. It seemed as
    though it were still actually burning, to heighten the
    sublimity of the scene. The huge albatross appeared here to
    dread no interloper or enemy; for their young were on the
    ground completely uncovered, and the old ones were stalking
    around them. This bird is the largest of the aquatic tribe; and
    its plumage is of a most delicate white, excepting the back and
    the tops of its wings, which are grey: they lay but one egg, on
    the ground, where they form a kind of nest, by scraping the
    earth round it. After the young one is hatched, it has to
    remain a year before it can fly; it is entirely white, and
    covered with a woolly down, which is very beautiful. As we
    approached them, they clapped their beaks, with a very quick
    motion, which made a great noise. This, and throwing up the
    contents of the stomach, are the only means of offence and
    defence they seem to possess. The old ones, which are valuable
    on account of their feathers, my companions made dreadful havoc
    amongst, knocking on the head all they could come up with.
    These birds are very helpless on the land, the great length of
    their wings precluding them from rising up into the air, unless
    they can get to a steep declivity. On the level ground they
    were completely at our mercy, but very little was shewn them;
    and in a very short space of time the plain was strewn with
    their bodies, one blow on the head generally killing them
    instantly. Five months after, many of the young birds were
    still sitting on their nests, and had never moved away from
    them; they remain there for a year before they can fly, and
    during that long period are fed by the mother. They had greatly
    increased in size and beauty since my first visit to them. The
    semblance of the young bird, as it sits on the nest, is stately
    and beautiful. The white down, which is its first covering,
    giving place gradually to its natural grey plumage, leaves half
    the creature covered with down; the other half is a fine
    compact coat of feathers, composed of white and grey; while the
    head is of a dazzling, silvery white. Their size is prodigious,
    one of them proving a tolerable load. Upon skinning them, on
    our return, we found they were covered with a fine white fat,
    which I was told was excellent for frying, and other culinary
    purposes; and the flesh was quite as delicate, and could
    scarcely be distinguished in flavour from lamb. Besides our
    albatross, the dogs caught some small birds, about the size of
    our partridge, but their gait was something like that of the
    penguin. The male is of a glossy black, with a bright red hard
    crest on the top of the head. The hen is brown. They stand
    erect, and have long yellow legs, with which they run very
    fast; their wings are small and useless for flying, but they
    are armed with sharp spurs for defence, and also, I imagine,
    for assisting them in climbing, as they are found generally
    among the rocks. The name they give this bird here is simply
    "cock," its only note being a noise very much resembling the
    repetition of that word. Its flesh is plump, fat, and excellent
    eating.</p>

    <a name="VISIT_TO_A_PENGUIN_ROOKERY"></a>

    <h3>VISIT TO A PENGUIN ROOKERY.</h3>

    <p>The spot of ground occupied by our settlers is bounded on
    each side by high <i>bluffs</i>, which extend far into the sea,
    leaving a space in front, where all their hogs run nearly wild,
    as they are prevented going beyond those limits by those
    natural barriers; and the creatures who, at stated periods,
    come up from the sea, remain in undisturbed possession of the
    beaches beyond our immediate vicinity. The weather being
    favourable, we launched our boat early in the morning, for the
    purpose of procuring a supply of eggs for the consumption of
    the family. We heard the chattering of the penguins from the
    rookery long before we landed, which was noisy in the extreme,
    and groups of them were scattered all over the beach; but the
    high thick grass on the declivity of the hill seemed their
    grand establishment, and they were hidden by it from our view.
    As we could not find any place where we could possibly land our
    boat in safety, I and two more swam on shore with bags tied
    round our necks to hold the eggs in, and the boat with one of
    the men lay off, out of the surf. I should think the ground
    occupied by these <i>birds</i> (if I may be allowed so to call
    them) was at least a mile in circumference, covered in every
    part with grasses and reeds, which grew considerably higher
    than my head; and on every gentle ascent, beginning from the
    beach, on all the large grey rocks, which occasionally appeared
    above this grass, sat perched groups of these strange and
    uncouth-looking creatures; but the noise which rose up from
    beneath baffles all description! As our business lay with the
    noisy part of this community, we quietly crept under the grass,
    and commenced our plundering search, though there needed none,
    so profuse was the quantity. The scene altogether well merits a
    better description than I can give--thousands, and hundreds of
    thousands, of these little two-legged erect monsters hopping
    around us, with voices very much resembling in tone that of the
    human; all opened their throats together: so thickly clustered
    in groups that it was almost impossible to place the foot
    without dispatching one of them. The shape of the animal, their
    curious motions, and their most extraordinary voices, made me
    fancy myself in a kingdom of pigmies. The regularity of their
    manners, their all sitting in exact rows, resembling more the
    order of a camp than a rookery of noisy birds, delighted me.
    These creatures did not move away on our approach, but only
    increased their noise, so we were obliged to displace them
    forcibly from their nests; and this ejectment was not produced
    without a considerable struggle on their parts; and, being
    armed with a formidable beak, it soon became a scene of
    desperate warfare. We had to take particular care to protect
    our hands and legs from their attacks: and for this purpose
    each one had provided himself with a short stout club. The
    noise they continued to make during our ramble through their
    territories the sailors said was, "Cover 'em up, cover 'em up."
    And, however incredible it may appear, it is nevertheless true,
    that I heard those words so distinctly repeated, and by such
    various tones of voices, that several times I started, and
    expected to see one of the men at my elbow. Even these little
    creatures, as well as the monstrous sea elephant, appear to
    keep up a continued warfare with each other. As the penguins
    sit in rows, forming regular lanes leading down to the beach,
    whenever one of them feels an inclination to refresh herself by
    a plunge into the sea, she has to run the gauntlet through the
    whole <i>street</i>, every one pecking at her as she passes
    without mercy; and though all are occupied in the same
    employment, not the smallest degree of friendship seems to
    exist; and whenever we turned one off her nest, she was sure to
    be thrown amongst foes; and, besides the loss of her eggs, was
    invariably doomed to receive a severe beating and pecking from
    her companions. Each one lays three eggs, and after a time,
    when the young are strong enough to undertake the journey, they
    go to sea, and are not again seen till the ensuing spring.
    Their city is deserted of its numerous inhabitants, and
    quietness reigns till nature prompts their return the following
    year, when the same noisy scene is repeated, as the same flock
    of birds returns to the spot where they were hatched. After
    raising a tremendous tumult in this numerous colony, and
    sustaining continued combat, we came off victorious, making
    capture of about a thousand eggs, resembling in size, colour,
    and transparency of shell, those of a duck; and the taking
    possession of this immense quantity did not occupy more than
    one hour, which may serve to prove the incalculable number of
    birds collected together. We did not allow them sufficient
    time, after landing, to lay all their eggs; for, had the season
    been further advanced, and we had found three eggs in each
    nest, the whole of them might probably have proved addled, the
    young partly formed, and the eggs of no use to us; but the
    whole of those we took turned out good, and had a particularly
    fine and delicate flavour. It was a work of considerable
    difficulty to get our booty safe into the boat--so frail a
    cargo--with so tremendous a surf running against us. However,
    we finally succeeded, though not without smashing a
    considerable number of the eggs.</p>

    <a name="THE_SEA_ELEPHANT"></a>

    <h3>THE SEA ELEPHANT.</h3>

    <p>I saw, for the first time, what the settlers call a
    <i>pod</i> of sea elephants. At this particular season these
    animals lay strewed about the beach, and, unless you disturb
    them, the sight of a man will not frighten them away. I was
    determined to get a good portrait of some of them, and
    accordingly took my sketch-book and pencil, and seated myself
    very near to one of them, and began my operations, feeling sure
    I had now got a most patient sitter, for they will lie for
    weeks together without stirring; but I had to keep throwing
    small pebbles at him, in order to make him open his eyes, and
    prevent his going to sleep. The flies appear to torment these
    unwieldy monsters most cruelly, their eyes and nostrils being
    stuffed full of them. I got a good sketch of the group. They
    appeared to stare at me occasionally with some little
    astonishment, stretching up their immense heads and looking
    around; but finding all still (I suppose they considered me a
    mere rock), they composed themselves to sleep again. They are
    the most shapeless creatures about the body. I could not help
    comparing them to an over-grown maggot, and their motion is
    similar to that insect. The face bears some rude resemblance to
    the human countenance; the eye is large, black, and expressive;
    excepting two very small flippers or paws at the shoulder, the
    whole body tapers down to a fish's tail; they are of a delicate
    mouse colour, the fur is very fine, but too oily for any other
    purpose than to make mocassins for the islanders. The bull is
    of an enormous size, and would weigh as heavily as his namesake
    of the land; and in that one thing consists their only
    resemblance, for no two animals can possibly be more unlike
    each other. It is a very curious phenomenon, how they can
    possibly exist on shore; for, from the first of their landing,
    they never go out to sea, and they lie on a stormy beach for
    months together without tasting any food, except consuming
    their own fat, for they gradually waste away; and as this fat
    or blubber is the great object of value, for which they are
    attacked and slaughtered, the settlers contrive to commence
    operations against them upon their first arrival, for it is
    well ascertained that they take no sustenance whatever on
    shore. I examined the contents of the stomach of one they had
    just killed, but could not make out the nature of what it
    contained. The matter was of a remarkably bright green colour.
    They have many enemies, even in the water; one called the
    killer, a species of grampus, which makes terrible havoc
    amongst them, and will attack and take away the carcass of one
    from alongside a boat. But man is their greatest enemy, and
    causes the most destruction to their race: he pursues them to
    all quarters of the globe.</p>

    <a name="VISIT_FROM_THE_NATIVES_AT_TERRA_DEL_FUEGO"></a>

    <h3><b>VISIT FROM THE NATIVES AT TERRA DEL FUEGO.</b></h3>

    <p>During our stay, we had, at various times, visits from the
    natives. They were all at first very shy, but after they found
    our friendly disposition towards them, they became more
    sociable and confiding.</p>

    <p>On the 11th of March three bark canoes arrived, containing
    four men, four women, and a girl about sixteen years old, four
    little boys and four infants, one of the latter about a week
    old, and quite naked. They had rude weapons, viz. slings to
    throw stones, three rude spears, pointed at the end with bone,
    and notched on one side with barbed teeth. With this they catch
    their fish, which are in great quantities among the kelp. Two
    of the natives were induced to come on board, after they had
    been alongside for upwards of an hour, and received many
    presents, for which they gave their spears, a dog, and some of
    their rude native trinkets. They did not shew or express
    surprise at anything on board, except when seeing one of the
    carpenters engaged in boring a hole with a screw-auger through
    a plank, which would have been a long task for them. They were
    very talkative, smiling when spoken to, and often bursting into
    loud laughter, but instantly settling into their natural
    serious and sober cast.</p>

    <p>They were found to be great mimics, both in gesture and
    sound, and would repeat any word of our language, with great
    correctness of pronunciation. Their imitations of sounds were
    truly astonishing.</p>

    <p>Their mimicry became at length annoying, and precluded our
    getting at any of their words or ideas. It not only extended to
    words or sounds, but actions also, and was at times truly
    ridiculous. The usual manner of interrogating for names was
    quite unsuccessful. On pointing to the nose, for instance, they
    did the same. Anything they saw done they would mimic, and with
    an extraordinary degree of accuracy. On these canoes
    approaching the ship, the principal one of the family, or
    chief, standing up in his canoe, made a harangue. Although they
    have been heard to shout quite loud, yet they cannot endure a
    noise; and when the drum beat, or a gun was fired, they
    invariably stopped their ears. They always speak to each other
    in a whisper.</p>

    <p>The women were never suffered to come on board. They
    appeared modest in the presence of strangers. They never move
    from a sitting posture, or rather a squat, with their knees
    close together, reaching to their chin, their feet in contact,
    and touching the lower part of the body. They are extremely
    ugly. Their hands and feet were small and well shaped; and,
    from appearance, they are not accustomed to do any hard work.
    They appear very fond and seem careful of their young children,
    though on several occasions they offered them for sale for a
    trifle. They have their faces smutted all over, and it was
    thought, from the hideous appearance of the females, produced
    in part by their being painted and smutted, that they had been
    disfigured by the men previous to coming alongside. It was
    remarked, that when one of them saw herself in a looking-glass,
    she burst into tears, as Jack thought, from pure
    mortification.</p>

    <p>Before they left the ship, the greater part of them were
    dressed in old clothes, that had been given to them by the
    officers and men, who all shewed themselves extremely anxious
    "to make them comfortable," This gave rise to much merriment,
    as Jack was not disposed to allow any difficulties to interfere
    in the fitting. If the jackets proved too tight across the
    shoulders, which they invariably were, a slit down the back
    effectually remedied the defect. If a pair of trousers was
    found too small around the waist, the knife was again resorted
    to; and in some cases a fit was made by severing the legs. The
    most difficult fit, and the one which produced the most
    merriment, was that of a woman, to whom an old coat was given.
    This, she concluded belonged to her nether limbs, and no signs,
    hints, or shouts, could correct her mistake. Her feet were
    thrust through the sleeves, and, after hard squeezing, she
    succeeded in drawing them on. With the skirts brought up in
    front, she took her seat in the canoe with great satisfaction,
    amid a roar of laughter from all who saw her.</p>

    <a name="CHILIAN_MODE_OF_CAPTURING_WILD_HORSES"></a>

    <h3>CHILIAN MODE OF CAPTURING WILD HORSES.</h3>

    <p>A party of four or five horsemen, with about twenty dogs,
    were seen formed in an extended crescent, driving the wild
    horses towards the river with shouts. All were armed with the
    lasso, which was swinging over their heads, to be in readiness
    to entrap the first that attempted to break through the
    gradually contracting segment; the dogs serving with the riders
    to head the horses in. They continued to advance, when suddenly
    a horse with furious speed broke the line, passing near one of
    the horsemen, and for a moment it was thought he had escaped;
    the next he was jerked round with a force that seemed
    sufficient to have broken his neck, the horseman having, the
    moment the lasso was thrown, turned round and braced himself
    for the shock. The captured horse now began to rear and plunge
    furiously to effect his escape. After becoming somewhat worn
    out, he was suffered to run, and again suddenly checked. This
    was repeated several times, when another plan was adopted. The
    dogs were set on him, and off he went at full run, in the
    direction of another horseman, who threw his lasso to entangle
    his legs and precipitate him to the ground. The dogs again
    roused him, when he again started, and was in like manner
    brought to a stand. After several trials he became completely
    exhausted and subdued, when he stood perfectly still, and
    allowed his captors to lay hands upon him. The shouts of the
    men, the barking of the dogs, and the scampering of the horses,
    made the whole scene extremely exciting.</p>

    <a name="FIGHT_BETWEEN_A_WHALE_AND_A_KILLER"></a>

    <h3>FIGHT BETWEEN A WHALE AND A KILLER.</h3>

    <p>This day, on board the Peacock, they witnessed a sea-fight
    between a whale and one of its many enemies. The sea was quite
    smooth, and offered the best possible view of the whole combat.
    First, at a distance from the ship, a whale was seen
    floundering in a most extraordinary way, lashing the smooth sea
    into a perfect foam, and endeavouring apparently to extricate
    himself from some annoyance. As he approached the ship, the
    struggle continuing and becoming more violent, it was perceived
    that a fish, apparently about twenty feet long, held him by the
    jaw, his contortions, spouting, and throes, all betokening the
    agony of the huge monster. The whale now threw himself at full
    length from the water with open mouth, his pursuer still
    hanging to the jaw, the blood issuing from the wound and dyeing
    the sea to a distance around; but all his flounderings were of
    no avail; his pertinacious enemy still maintained his hold, and
    was evidently getting the advantage of him. Much alarm seemed
    to be felt by the many other whales around. These "killers," as
    they are called, are of a brownish colour on the back, and
    white on the belly, with a long dorsal fin. Such was the
    turbulence with which they passed, that a good view could not
    be had of them to make out more nearly the description. These
    fish attack a whale in the same way as dogs bait a bull, and
    worry him to death. They are armed with strong sharp teeth, and
    generally seize the whale by the lower jaw. It is said that the
    only part of them they eat is the tongue. The whalers give some
    marvellous accounts of these killers, and of their immense
    strength; among them, that they have been known to drag a whale
    away from several boats which were towing it to the ship.</p>
    <hr style="width: 65%;">
    <a name="WAR_DANCES_OF_THE_NEW_ZEALANDERS"></a>

    <h3>WAR DANCES OF THE NEW ZEALANDERS.</h3>

    <p>Wishing to see their war-dances, I requested the chief
    Pomare to gratify us with an exhibition, which he consented to
    do. The ground chosen was the hillside of Mr. Clendon, our
    consul's place, where between three and four hundred natives,
    with their wives and children, assembled. Pomare divided the
    men into three parties or squads, and stationed these at some
    distance from each other. Shortly after this was done, I
    received a message from him, to say that they were all hungry,
    and wanted me to treat them to something to eat. This was
    refused until they had finished their dance, and much delay
    took place in consequence. Pomare and his warriors were at
    first immoveable; but they, in a short time, determined they
    would unite on the hill-top, which was accordingly ordered,
    although I was told they were too hungry to dance well. Here
    they arranged themselves in a solid column, and began stamping,
    shouting, jumping, and shaking their guns, clubs, and paddles
    in the air, with violent gesticulations, to a sort of savage
    time. A more grotesque group cannot well be imagined; dressed,
    half-dressed, or entirely naked. After much preliminary action,
    they all set off, with a frantic shout, at full speed in a
    war-charge, which not only put to flight all the animals that
    were feeding in the neighbourhood, but startled the spectators.
    After running about two hundred and fifty yards, they fired
    their guns and halted, with another shout. They then returned
    in the same manner, and stopped before us, a truly savage
    multitude, wrought up to apparent frenzy, and exhibiting all
    the modes practised of maiming and killing their enemies, until
    they became exhausted, and lay down on the ground like tired
    dogs, panting for breath. One of the chiefs then took an old
    broken dragoon-sword, and began running to and fro before us,
    flourishing it, and, at the same time, delivering a speech at
    the top of his voice. The speech, as interpreted to me, ran
    thus: "You are welcome, you are our friends, and we are glad to
    see you," frequently repeated. After three or four had shewn
    off in this way, they determined they must have something to
    eat, saying that I had promised them rice and sugar, and they
    ought to have it. Mr. Clendon, however, persuaded them to give
    one of their feast-dances. The performers consisted of about
    fifteen old, and as many young persons, whom they arranged in
    close order. The young girls laid aside a part of their dress
    to exhibit their forms to more advantage, and they commenced a
    kind of recitative, accompanied by all manner of
    gesticulations, with a sort of guttural husk for a chorus. It
    was not necessary to understand their language to comprehend
    their meaning; and it is unnecessary to add, that their tastes
    did not appear very refined, but were similar to what we have
    constantly observed among the heathen nations of Polynesia.
    Their impatience now became ungovernable; and hearing that the
    rice and sugar were being served out, they retreated
    precipitately down the hill, where they all set to most
    heartily, with their wives and children, to devour the food.
    This, to me, was the most entertaining part of the exhibition.
    They did not appear selfish towards each other; the children
    were taken care of, and all seemed to enjoy themselves. I
    received many thanks in passing among them, and their
    countenances betokened contentment. Although they were clothed
    for the occasion in their best, they exhibited but a squalid
    and dirty appearance, both in their dress and persons.</p>

    <p>We now end our extracts from this very entertaining
    Work,--upon the resources of which we have so largely
    drawn,--by the history of Paddy Connel, as described by
    himself, and who had been a resident among the Feejeean savages
    for nearly forty years.</p>
    <hr style="width: 65%;">
    <a name="HISTORY_OF_PADDY_CONNEL"></a>

    <h3><b>HISTORY OF PADDY CONNEL.</b></h3>

    <p>One day, while at the Observatory, I was greatly surprised
    at seeing one whom I took to be a Feejeeman, enter my tent, a
    circumstance so inconsistent with the respect to our prescribed
    limit, of which I have spoken. His colour, however, struck me
    as lighter than that of any native I had yet seen. He was a
    short wrinkled old man, but appeared to possess great vigour
    and activity. He had a beard that reached to his middle, and
    but little hair, of a reddish-grey colour, on his head. He gave
    me no time for inquiry, but at once addressed me in broad
    Irish, with a rich Milesian brogue. In a few minutes he made me
    acquainted with his story, which, by his own account, was as
    follows:--</p>

    <p>His name was Paddy Connel, but the natives called him Berry;
    he was born in the county of Clare, in Ireland; had run away
    from school when he was a little fellow, and after wandering
    about as a vagabond, was pressed into the army in the first
    Irish rebellion. At the time the French landed in Ireland, the
    regiment to which he was attached marched at once against the
    enemy, and soon arrived on the field of battle, where they were
    brought to the charge. The first thing he knew or heard, the
    drums struck up a White Boy's tune, and his whole regiment went
    over and joined the French, with the exception of the officers,
    who had to flee. They were then marched against the British,
    and were soon defeated by Lord Cornwallis; it was a hard fight,
    and Paddy found himself among the slain. When he thought the
    battle was over, and night came on, he crawled off and reached
    home. He was then taken up and tried for his life, but was
    acquitted; he was, however, remanded to prison, and busied
    himself in effecting the escape of some of his comrades. On
    this being discovered, he was confined in the black hole, and
    soon after sent to Cork, to be put on board a convict-ship
    bound to New South Wales. When he arrived there, his name was
    not found on the books of the prisoners; consequently he had
    been transported by mistake, and was, therefore, set at
    liberty. He then worked about for several years, and collected
    a small sum of money, but unfortunately fell into bad company,
    got drunk, and lost it all. Just about this time Captain
    Sartori, of the ship General Wellesley, arrived at Sydney.
    Having lost a great part of his crew by sickness and desertion,
    he desired to procure hands for his ship, which was still at
    Sandalwood Bay, and obtained thirty-five men, one of whom was
    Paddy Connel. At the time they were ready to depart, a French
    privateer, Le Gloriant, Captain Dubardieu, put into Sydney,
    when Captain Sartori engaged a passage for himself and his men
    to the Feejees. On their way they touched at Norfolk Island,
    where the ship struck, and damaged her keel so much that they
    were obliged to put into the Bay of Islands for repairs. Paddy
    asserts that a difficulty had occurred here between Captain
    Sartori and his men about their provisions, which was amicably
    settled. The Gloriant finally sailed from New Zealand for
    Tongataboo, where they arrived just after the capture of a
    vessel, which he supposed to have been the Port au Prince, as
    they had obtained many articles from the natives, which had
    evidently belonged to some large vessel. Here they remained
    some months, and then sailed for Sandalwood Bay, where the men,
    on account of their former quarrel with Captain Sartori,
    refused to go on board the General Wellesley: some of them
    shipped on board the Gloriant, and others, with Paddy,
    determined to remain on shore with the natives. He added, that
    Captain Sartori was kind to him, and at parting had given him a
    pistol, cutlass, and an old good-for-nothing musket; these,
    with his sea-chest and a few clothes, were all that he
    possessed. He had now lived forty years among these savages.
    After hearing his whole story, I told him I did not believe a
    word of it; to which he answered, that the main part of it was
    true, but he might have made some mistakes, as he had been so
    much in the habit of lying to the Feejeeans, that he hardly now
    knew when he told the truth, adding, that he had no desire to
    tell anything but the truth.</p>

    <p>Paddy turned out to be a very amusing fellow, and possessed
    an accurate knowledge of the Feejee character. Some of the
    whites told me that he was more than half Feejee; indeed he
    seemed to delight in shewing how nearly he was allied to them
    in feeling and propensities; and, like them, seemed to fix his
    attention upon trifles. He gave me a droll account of his daily
    employments, which it would be inappropriate to give here, and
    finished by telling me the only wish he had then, was to get
    for his little boy, on whom he doated, a small hatchet; and the
    only articles he had to offer for it were a few old hens. On my
    asking him if he did not cultivate the ground, he said at once
    no; he found it much easier to get his living by telling the
    Feejeeans stories, which he could always make good enough for
    them;--these, and the care of his two little boys, and his
    hens, and his pigs, when he had any, gave him ample employment
    and plenty of food. He had lived much at Rewa, and, until
    lately, had been a resident at Levuka, but had, in consequence
    of his intrigues, been expelled by the white residents, to the
    island of Ambatiki. It appeared that they had unanimously come
    to the conclusion, that if he did not remove, they would be
    obliged to put him to death for their own safety. I could not
    induce Whippy or Tom to give me the circumstances that
    occasioned this determination; and Paddy would not communicate
    more than that his residence on Ambatiki was a forced one, and
    that it was as though he was living out of the world, rearing
    pigs, fowls, and children. Of the last description of live
    stock he had forty-eight, and hoped that he might live to see
    fifty born to him. He had had one hundred wives.</p>

    <h2><b>Extraordinary Escape from Drowning.</b></h2>

    <p>The following Narrative of an extraordinary escape from
    drowning, after being wrecked among the Rapids of the St.
    Lawrence, first appeared in the <i>Liverpool Mercury</i>, the
    Editors of which state that they have published it by
    permission of the writer, who is a well-known merchant of great
    respectability in that city. We have extracted it from the
    pages of the <i>Edinburgh Magazine</i>, the Editor of which
    remarks,--"We have been induced to transfer it into our
    Miscellany, not merely from the uncommon interest of the
    detail, but because we happen to be able to vouch for its
    authenticity."</p>

    <p>On the 22nd day of April, 1810, our party set sail in a
    large schooner from Fort-George, or Niagara Town, and in two
    days crossed Lake Ontario to Kingston, at the head of the river
    St. Lawrence, distant from Niagara about 200 miles. Here we
    hired an American barge (a large flat-bottomed boat) to carry
    us to Montreal, a further distance of 200 miles; then set out
    from Kingston on the 28th of April, and arrived the same
    evening at Ogdensburgh, a distance of 75 miles. The following
    evening we arrived at Cornwall, and the succeeding night at
    Pointe du Lac, on Lake St. Francis. Here our bargemen obtained
    our permission to return up the river; and we embarked in
    another barge, deeply laden with potashes, passengers, and
    luggage. Above Montreal, for nearly 100 miles, the river St.
    Lawrence is interrupted in its course by rapids, which are
    occasioned by the river being confined in comparatively narrow,
    shallow, rocky channels;--through these it rushes with great
    force and noise, and is agitated like the ocean in a storm.
    Many people prefer these rapids, for grandeur of appearance, to
    the Falls of Niagara. They are from half a mile to nine miles
    long each, and require regular pilots. On the 30th of April we
    arrived at the village of the Cedars, immediately below which
    are three sets of very dangerous rapids (the Cedars, the
    Split-rock, and the Cascades), distant from each other about
    one mile. On the morning of the 1st of May we set out from the
    Cedars, the barge very deep and very leaky. The captain, a
    daring rash man, refused to take a pilot. After we passed the
    Cedar rapid, not without danger, the captain called for some
    rum, swearing, at the same time, that ---- could not steer the
    barge better than he did! Soon after this we entered the
    Split-rock rapids by a wrong channel, and found ourselves
    advancing rapidly towards a dreadful watery precipice, down
    which we went. The barge slightly grazed her bottom against the
    rock, and the fall was so great as to nearly take away the
    breath. We here took in a great deal of water, which was mostly
    baled out again before we were hurried on to what the Canadians
    call the "grand bouillon," or great boiling. In approaching
    this place the captain let go the helm, saying, "Here we fill!"
    The barge was almost immediately overwhelmed in the midst of
    immense foaming breakers, which rushed over the bows, carrying
    away planks, oars, &amp;c. About half a minute elapsed between
    the filling and going down of the barge, during which I had
    sufficient presence of mind to rip off my three coats, and was
    loosening my suspenders, when the barge sunk, and I found
    myself floating in the midst of people, baggage, &amp;c. Each
    man caught hold of something; one of the crew caught hold of
    me, and kept me down under water, but, contrary to my
    expectation, let me go again. On rising to the surface, I got
    hold of a trunk, on which two other men were then holding. Just
    at this spot, where the Split-rock rapids terminate, the bank
    of the river is well inhabited; and we could see women on shore
    running about much agitated. A canoe put off, and picked up
    three of our number, who had gained the bottom of the barge,
    which had upset and got rid of its cargo; these they landed on
    an island. The canoe put off again, and was approaching near to
    where I was, with two others, holding on by the trunk, when,
    terrified with the vicinity of the Cascades, to which we were
    approaching, it put back, notwithstanding my exhortations, in
    French and English, to induce the two men on board to advance.
    The bad hold which one man had of the trunk, to which we were
    adhering, subjected him to constant immersion; and, in order to
    escape his seizing hold of me, I let go the trunk, and, in
    conjunction with another man, got hold of the boom, (which,
    with the gaff, sails, &amp;c., had been detached from the mast,
    to make room for the cargo,) and floated off. I had just time
    to grasp this boom, when we were hurried into the Cascades; in
    these I was instantly buried, and nearly suffocated. On rising
    to the surface, I found one of my hands still on the boom, and
    my companion also adhering to the gaff. Shortly after
    descending the Cascades, I perceived the barge, bottom upwards,
    floating near me. I succeeded in getting to it, and held by a
    crack in one end of it; the violence of the water, and the
    falling out of the casks of ashes, had quite wrecked it. For a
    long time I contented myself with this hold, not daring to
    endeavour to get upon the bottom, which I at length effected;
    and from this, my new situation, I called out to my companion,
    who still preserved his hold of the gaff. He shook his head;
    and, when the waves suffered me to look up again, he was gone.
    He made no attempt to come near me, being unable or unwilling
    to let go his hold, and trust himself to the waves, which were
    then rolling over his head.</p>

    <p>The Cascades are a kind of fall, or rapid descent, in the
    river, over a rocky channel below: going down is called, by the
    French, "Sauter," to leap or shove the cascades. For two miles
    below, the channel continues in uproar, just like a storm at
    sea; and I was frequently nearly washed off the barge by the
    waves which rolled over. I now entertained no hope whatever of
    escaping; and although I continued to exert myself to hold on,
    such was the state to which I was reduced by cold, that I
    wished only for speedy death, and frequently thought of giving
    up the contest as useless. I felt as if compressed into the
    size of a monkey; my hands appeared diminished in size
    one-half; and I certainly should (after I became cold and much
    exhausted) have fallen asleep, but for the waves that were
    passing over me, and obliged me to attend to my situation. I
    had never descended the St. Lawrence before, but I knew there
    were more rapids a-head, perhaps another set of the Cascades,
    but at all events the La Chine rapids, whose situation I did
    not exactly know. I was in hourly expectation of these putting
    an end to me, and often fancied some points of ice extending
    from the shore to be the head of foaming rapids. At one of the
    moments in which the succession of waves permitted me to look
    up, I saw at a distance a canoe with four men coming towards
    me, and waited in confidence to hear the sound of their
    paddles; but in this I was disappointed; the men, as I
    afterwards learnt, were Indians (genuine descendants of the
    Tartars) who, happening to fall in with one of the passenger's
    trunks, picked it up, and returned to shore for the purpose of
    pillaging it, leaving, as they since acknowledged, the man on
    the boat to his fate. Indeed, I am certain I should have had
    more to fear from their avarice, than to hope from their
    humanity; and it is more than probable, that my life would have
    been taken to secure them in the possession of my watch and
    several half-eagles, which I had about me.</p>

    <p>The accident happened at eight o'clock in the morning. In
    the course of some hours, as the day advanced, the sun grew
    warmer, the wind blew from the south, and the water became
    calmer. I got upon my knees, and found myself in the small lake
    St. Louis, about from three to five miles wide; with some
    difficulty I got upon my feet, but was soon convinced, by
    cramps and spasms in all my sinews, that I was quite incapable
    of swimming any distance, and I was then two miles from shore.
    I was now going, with wind and current, to destruction; and
    cold, hungry, and fatigued, was obliged again to sit down in
    the water to rest, when an extraordinary circumstance greatly
    relieved me. On examining the wreck, to see if it was possible
    to detach any part of it to steer by, I perceived something
    loose, entangled in a fork of the wreck, and so carried along.
    This I found to be a small trunk, bottom upwards, which, with
    some difficulty, I dragged up upon the barge. After near an
    hour's work, in which I broke my pen-knife, trying to cut out
    the lock, I made a hole in the top, and, to my great
    satisfaction, drew out a bottle of rum, a cold tongue, some
    cheese, and a bag full of bread, cakes, &amp;c., all wet. Of
    these I made a very seasonable, though very moderate use, and
    the trunk answered the purpose of a chair to sit upon, elevated
    above the surface of the water.</p>

    <p>After in vain endeavouring to steer the wreck, or direct its
    course to the shore, and having made every signal (with my
    waistcoat, &amp;c.) in my power, to the several headlands which
    I had passed, I fancied I was driving into a bay, which,
    however, soon proved to be the termination of the lake, and the
    opening of the river, the current of which was carrying me
    rapidly along. I passed several small uninhabited islands; but
    the banks of the river appearing to be covered with houses, I
    again renewed my signals with my waistcoat and a shirt, which I
    took out of the trunk, hoping, as the river narrowed, they
    might be perceived; the distance was too great. The velocity
    with which I was going convinced me of my near approach to the
    dreadful rapids of La Chine. Night was drawing on; my
    destruction appeared certain, but did not disturb me very much:
    the idea of death had lost its novelty, and become quite
    familiar. Finding signals in vain, I now set up a cry or howl,
    such as I thought best calculated to carry to a distance, and,
    being favoured by the wind, it did, although at above a mile
    distance, reach the ears of some people on shore. At last I
    perceived a boat rowing towards me, which, being very small and
    white-bottomed, I had some time taken for a fowl with a white
    breast; and I was taken off the barge by Captain Johnstone,
    after being ten hours on the water. I found myself at the
    village of La Chine, 21 miles below where the accident
    happened, and having been driven by the winding of the current
    a much greater distance. I received no other injury than
    bruised knees and breast, with a slight cold. The accident took
    some hold of my imagination, and, for seven or eight succeeding
    nights, in my dreams, I was engaged in the dangers of the
    Cascades, and surrounded by drowning men.</p>

    <p>My escape was owing to a concurrence of fortunate
    circumstances, which appear almost providential. I happened to
    catch hold of various articles of support, and to exchange each
    article for another just at the right time. Nothing but the
    boom could have carried me down the Cascades without injury;
    and nothing but the barge could have saved me below them. I was
    also fortunate in having the whole day. Had the accident
    happened one hour later, I should have arrived opposite the
    village of La Chine after dark, and, of course, would have been
    destroyed in the rapids below, to which I was rapidly
    advancing. The trunk which furnished me with provisions and a
    resting-place above the water, I have every reason to think,
    was necessary to save my life; without it I must have passed
    the whole time in the water, and been exhausted with cold and
    hunger. When the people on shore saw our boat take the wrong
    channel, they predicted our destruction: the floating luggage,
    by supporting us for a time, enabled them to make an exertion
    to save us; but as it was not supposed possible to survive the
    passage of the Cascades, no further exertions were thought of,
    nor indeed could they well have been made.</p>

    <p>It was at this very place that General Ambert's brigade of
    300 men, coming to attack Canada, was lost; the French at
    Montreal received the first intelligence of the invasion, by
    the dead bodies floating past the town. The pilot who conducted
    the first batteaux, committing the same error that we did, ran
    for the wrong channel, and the other batteaux following close,
    all were involved in the same destruction. The whole party with
    which I was escaped; four left the barge at the Cedar village,
    above the rapids, and went to Montreal by land; two more were
    saved by the canoe; the barge's crew, all accustomed to labour,
    were lost. Of the eight men who passed down the Cascades, none
    but myself escaped, or were seen again; nor indeed was it
    possible for any one, without my extraordinary luck, and the
    aid of the barge, to which they must have been very close, to
    have escaped; the other men must have been drowned immediately
    on entering the Cascades. The trunks, &amp;c., to which they
    adhered, and the heavy great-coats which they had on, very
    probably helped to overwhelm them; but they must have gone at
    all events; swimming in such a current of broken stormy waves
    was impossible. Still I think my knowing how to swim kept me
    more collected, and rendered me more willing to part with one
    article of support to gain a better. Those who could not swim
    would naturally cling to whatever hold they first got, and, of
    course, many had very bad ones. The Captain passed me above the
    Cascades, on a sack of woollen clothes, which were doubtless
    soon saturated and sunk.</p>

    <p>The trunk which I picked up belonged to a young man from
    Upper Canada, who was one of those drowned; it contained
    clothes, and about &pound;70 in gold, which was restored to his
    friends. My own trunk contained, besides clothes, about
    &pound;200 in gold and bank notes. On my arrival at La Chine, I
    offered a reward of 100 dollars, which induced a Canadian to go
    in search of it. He found it, some days after, on the shore of
    an island on which it had been driven, and brought it to La
    Chine, where I happened to be at the time. I paid him his
    reward, and understood that above one-third of it was to be
    immediately applied to the purchase of a certain number of
    masses which he had vowed, in the event of success, previous to
    his setting out on the search.</p>

    <a name="Adventure_in_the_Desert_and_Murder_of_a_Sheikh"></a>

    <h2><b>Adventure in the Desert, and Murder of a
    Sheikh.</b></h2>

    <p>I was awakened for a few minutes, as early as three o'clock
    on the following morning, by the sound of many voices in loud
    and earnest conversation, amongst which I recognised that of
    Sheikh Suleiman; but as noisy conversations at such early hours
    are by no means uncommon with these restless spirits of the
    wilderness, I gave no heed to it, and composed myself for sleep
    again, intending to rise by about half after four, in order to
    get a dip in the Red Sea, before resuming the march; and this
    intention I fulfilled; but just while throwing on the few
    clothes I had taken with me, I heard suddenly a loud strife of
    many tongues bursting forth, not in our encampment, but in a
    small copse or grove of palm trees, about two hundred yards
    distant. At once the thought rushed upon my mind, that the
    Mezzeni had overtaken us, and were meditating an attack, now
    that we were so near the place of their main encampment. This
    was directly confirmed by the sound of a gun-shot in the
    palm-grove, which was soon followed up by a second. I ran up
    towards the encampment as rapidly as possible; and just as I
    reached it, another shot rang awfully upon my ear. I found our
    party in a state of the greatest consternation, and gathered
    closely together, gazing wildly towards the grove. The first
    thing I learnt, was the harrowing fact, that poor Suleiman had
    just been murdered by the Mezzeni! It was an astounding
    announcement. To what would this desperate blow lead--here, in
    the Desert? The prospect of further bloodshed was terrible. It
    would have been insupportable, but for the influence of that
    inward calmness which is the privilege of the children of God.
    We were braced up for the worst, and stood gazing upon the
    scene, in full expectation that out of a deep and deadly spirit
    of revenge, we should be immediately overpowered by the enemy,
    and held entirely at their mercy--as any shew of defence
    against so many as had now come down upon us, would have been
    utterly futile, and might have led to the destruction of us
    all. How wild and desolate this awful theatre of death
    appeared, while, with the sound of gun-shots still vibrating in
    our ears, we thought of Suleiman writhing in his death-throes,
    and anxiously watched the movements of the murderers. We were
    motionless--almost breathless. Each man among us gazed silently
    upon his fellow. Our suspense was not of great duration, but
    long enough to get the heart secretly lifted up in communion
    with a God of mercy. And there was sweet peacefulness in that
    brief exercise.... My worst fears were groundless. The hearts
    of all men are in God's hands. Our helplessness must have been
    a powerful matter of temptation to the blood-stained men, over
    whom the departed soul of Suleiman was hovering. But God
    restrained them....</p>

    <p>Having slaughtered their victim, the Mezzeni (of whom above
    forty were counted), quietly marched back towards Nuweibia,
    without exchanging even a word with us; leaving behind them the
    corpse of poor Suleiman--a sad memorial of their malignant
    vengeance; while several others of their tribe, who had been
    lying in ambush beyond the scene of terror, came forth from
    their hiding-places, and joined their retreating comrades.</p>

    <p>My heart almost sickens at the recollection of this dreadful
    transaction, while referring to the notes made on the spot, and
    compiling from them the particulars of this sad page.</p>

    <p>As soon as the enemy had fairly departed, I took Hassenein
    with me, and advanced carefully towards the copse of palm
    trees, where I found the mangled body of poor Suleiman quite
    dead, but with the agony of the death-pang still visible on his
    sunburnt and swarthy features. It was a terrible sight, thus to
    behold the leader and confidential companion of our wild route,
    lying as the clods of the valley, and saturated with his own
    life-blood. And how, in a Christian's heart, was the sense of
    the sad reality heightened, by knowing that the poor sufferer
    was a follower of the false prophet--a Mahommedan--ignorant of
    Him who was "delivered for our offences, and raised again for
    our justification." I have seen death in many forms; but I
    never beheld it with so dread an aspect as it here assumed.</p>

    <p>I was more than half inclined to withhold the minute
    particulars of the dark tragedy, when arriving at this part of
    my narrative; but they now fasten themselves upon my mind, and
    I feel constrained to leave them on record.</p>

    <p>Suleiman had received three balls through his body, and four
    sabre-gashes on his head, which was also nearly severed from
    the trunk; and his right arm, which had been evidently raised
    in an attempt at warding off a blow, was all but divided near
    the wrist. We returned to the encampment, where our Arabs were
    sitting together, still terrified. At length a few of them who
    volunteered their aid, went and washed the body--wrapped it in
    an unfolded turban, and prepared it for immediate interment.
    They hastily formed a resting-place, about a mile upwards,
    towards the hills which skirted the plain in which we were
    encamped, by raising four walls of large loose stones. Having
    made all ready, they brought up the remains of their leader,
    laid across the back of his camel, and, with deep emotion,
    deposited them in their final abode, arching it over with large
    masses of stone, and quitting it with what appeared to me like
    deep expressions of vengeance against the tribe, on which lay
    the guilt of his murder.</p>

    <p>I turned away from the tomb with a heavy heart.... Was my
    way to the Holy City of my God to be tracked with blood?</p>

    <p>On making a careful inquiry into the particulars immediately
    connected with this sad catastrophe, I collected the
    following:-It appeared, that while we were resting on the
    previous day at Wadey el Ay&uacute;n, the Mezzeni came down in
    order to make a final effort at supporting, without bloodshed,
    their claim to conduct travellers through their territory to
    Akabah. Sheikh Furriqh was of the number, as I have already
    stated. When he was about to retire, after an unsuccessful
    attempt, an Arab of his tribe came and secretly informed him
    that his (Furriqh's) nephew had been shot on the previous day
    by one of Suleiman's tribe, in reference to the very question
    then pending. On receiving this information, Furriqh at once
    broke off all negotiation, and quitted the encampment. It is
    believed that Suleiman never knew the fact which had been
    communicated to Furriqh; but news was brought to him that the
    Mezzeni intended to pursue us with an increased force; and this
    quite accounts for all the anxiety and timidity which he
    evinced during the afternoon and evening preceding his death.
    It appears that the Mezzeni, bent on accomplishing their
    purpose, gathered together their force, and, following us at
    dromedary speed, arrived at the encampment as early as two
    o'clock in the morning--that a deputation from them came to
    Suleiman, while some of the rest remained in the palm-grove,
    and others went in advance, and formed ambuscades--that Sheikh
    Furriqh was one of the deputation--that Suleiman shewed them
    the usual hospitality of breaking bread with them--that the
    conference ended without any adjustment of the matter in
    dispute--that after the deputation had retired to the copse,
    two Arabs of a neutral tribe, who had come with us from Mount
    Sinai, went to the Mezzeni in order to mediate, but were
    unsuccessful--that while they remained Suleiman was sent for,
    and that having broken bread with the Mezzeni, he had a right
    to expect that his life would be held sacred--that Suleiman had
    scarcely reached the adverse party, when Sheikh Furriqh
    said--"We do not care about the money, but there is blood
    between us;"--that instantly one of the Mezzeni shot him
    through the body, and that Furriqh cut him down with his sabre,
    while two other shots which were fired took effect upon him. My
    recollection of Furriqh, from the first moment that he appeared
    in our caravan, is such as to convince me that he would readily
    commit such an act as this--so subtle--so cruel--so
    cowardly--without one feeling of remorse or misgiving.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

     http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
